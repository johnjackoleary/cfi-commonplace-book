*First Draft*
> Hi Steve,
> 
> I’m a private pilot who has been with the club since 2018. I attended an ownership seminar a few years ago, but the numbers didn't quite worked out to justify buying a plane.
> 
> I’ve recently decided to pursue a career as a flight instructor, and suspect the additional hours of training (I still have to complete my IFR, commercial, and instructor training), and time I’ll spend flying generally, may make this a worthwhile investment.
> 
> Both the DA40 and Citabria are planes I’d be interested in owning, although for different purposes. I enjoy casually flying with friends around the Bay, and would use the Citabria for that case. I also have family in Seattle & Minneapolis I’d like to visit on occasion, and would use the DA40 under IFR for those sorts of trips.
> 
> I’m new to what this process would look like, so was hoping to get your input early while I figure out what makes sense for aircraft type and timelines. Any advice you have is greatly appreciated.
> 
> A few specific questions on my mind:
> Knowing I’d be using this in part to teach, have you heard of flight instructors who are able to write off a purchase like this as a business expense?
>  I’ve heard both the DA40 and Citabria are great planes for the club, because they are just about at critical mass and so should be rented pretty regularly. Do you have an estimate on how many hours I could expect each of these planes to fly?
> Are there policy documents I can reference from the club about ownership? For instance, I would like to use the DA40 (if I go that route) for long trips back to the midwest occasionally. How does cost-per-hour work as the owner? What about non-flying day rates?
> Could I teach using the plane if a student was not part of the club?
> Also, I remember from the seminar a set of slides and a spreadsheet you had of aircraft ownership costs — could you share a copy of thse so I can start refreshing on policies and playing with numbers?
> 
> Thank you,
> Jack
