"Itâ€™s not meant to be a do-list. If you use a checklist as a do-list, you only have one opportunity to catch an error. If you have a before-takeoff flow that is followed by a checklist, you have two chances to catch an error." - https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2016/december/flight-training-magazine/career-pilot-checklist
