***Key Quotes***:
* This Advisory Circular ([[Filed/AC]]) describes the standards and provides guidance in the development of a Surface Movement Guidance and Control System ([[SMGCS]]) plan for U.S. airports where scheduled Air Carriers are authorized to conduct operations when the visibility is less than 1,200 feet runway visual range (RVR).
* A SMGCS plan facilitates the safe movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airport by establishing more rigorous control procedures and requiring enhanced visual aids.
