***Description***      :: Overview of Force, Work, Power, and Torque
***Author*** :: [[Aviation Physics]]

***Key Quotes***:
* [[Work]], in the mechanical sense of the term, is done when a resistance is overcome by force acting through a measurable distance. Two factors are involved: (1) force and (2) movement through a distance.
* The concept of [[Power]] involves the previously discussed topic of work, which was a force being applied over a measured distance, but adds one more considerationâ€”time. In other words, how long it takes to accomplish the work.
* Whereas work is described as force acting through a distance, torque is described as force acting along a distance. [[Torque]] is something that creates twisting and tries to make something rotate.
