***Description***      :: `= this.link`
***Author*** :: [[FAA]]

***Key Quotes***:
* This [[AC]] explains the stall and spin awareness training... and offers guidance to flight instructors who provide it
* This AC also informs pilots of the airworthiness standards for the type certification of normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes
* most stall/spin accidents result when a pilot is distracted momentarily from the primary task of flying the aircraft
* The primary cause of an inadvertent spin is exceeding the critical AOA while applying excessive or insufficient rudder and, to a lesser extent, aileron.
