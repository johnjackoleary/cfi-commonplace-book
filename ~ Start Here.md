> One of my favorite parts of aviation is the community it brings together. This project is meant to allow others in the community to bring together ideas, resources, and learnings.

> I'll also use it to teach students and hope that students will contribute their own insights as they learn.

> My hope is you find this CFI commonplace book a useful starting point for your own work, and that you feel welcome to contribute your own learnings back.
