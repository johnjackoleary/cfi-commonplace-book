# Key Takeaways
- Heavy, clean, and slow aircraft generate the largest wake turbulence.
- To avoid wake turbulence
	- Avoid flying through another aircraft’s flight path.
	- Avoid following another aircraft at an altitude within 1,000 feet.
	- Rotate prior to the point at which the preceding aircraft rotated when taking off behind another aircraft.
	- Approach the runway above a preceding aircraft’s path when landing behind another aircraft and touch down after the point at which the other aircraft wheels contacted the runway.
- If unsure, give 3 minutes for turbulence to dissipate.
