## Eights on Pylons

**Objective:** To develop knowledge of pivotal altitude and the skill to maneuver the airplane accurately, while dividing attention between the flight path and the selected pylons.
**References:** [[Commercial ACS]], [[AFH Ch6]]
**Builds On:** [[Performance Maneuvers - Ground Reference Maneuvers]]
**Schedule:** Ground 0.5, Flight 1.0
**Lesson Elements:** 
1. Overview
	1. This is the most advanced ground reference maneuver.
	2. It requires the pilot to demonstrate ability to plan and select an appropriate location, the skill to fly the maneuver precisely, and the situational awareness to divide attention between the ground references, instruments, traffic, and emergency field location.
2. Pivotal Altitude
	1. Eights on pylons is all based on [[pivotal altitude]]: `[[pivotal altitude]].defition`

**Completion Standards:** Client must calculate and enter at pivotal altitude, select suitable pylons which allow straight-and-level flight between (3-5 seconds), establish a bank angle <40Â°, and maintain pylon in line-of-sight without slips/skids. Client must be able to divide attention inside and outside aircraft.

**Required Homework:** 
- [ ] Memorize pivotal altitude formula

**Recommended Homework:** 
- [ ] Chair fly maneuver
