Questions:
- what’s the rule on going out to practice teaching spins as far as parchutes?

Sometimes scenario based is probably not good for spins, already intense enough without

Archers and cherokees generally are sometimes not certified for spins in utility 

“Must be inmpossinle to obtain uncontrollable spins with any control inputs”, or something like this 

C172SP G1000 is hard to get into the utility catagoru because weoght of avionics in back

Need to teach procedure on ground because either speed up talking to slow down recovery, neither of which really work

Keep it calm for teaching even if things getting exciting 

Not finished until climbing 

6000’ recommended in case. 25 turns to loose 6000’ (3 turns to loose 1500’, 6 turns to loose 2000’)

Make sure stick not forward too long on recovery
