Once airborne, the airplane gains energy from the force of engine thrust (T) and it loses energy from aerodynamic drag (D). The 
difference between energy in and out (T – D) is the net change, which determines whether total mechanical energy—stored as altitude 
and airspeed—increases, decreases, or remains the same.
