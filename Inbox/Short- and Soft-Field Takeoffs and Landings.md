## Short- and Soft-Field Takeoffs and Landings

**Objective:** Develop knowledge and skills for soft-field (unpaved) takeoffs and landings, and short-field takeoffs and landings.
**References:** ACS Sec IV Task E-F; AFH Ch 5, 8
**Builds On:** [[Normal and Crosswind Takeoffs and Climbs]], [[Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]], [[Go-Arounds and Rejected Landings]]
**Schedule:** Ground 1.0; Flight â€“ multiple flights, with frequent practice
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Overview of short- and soft-field operations
2. Takeoffs and Climb Procedures
	1. Set flaps according to POH/AFM
	2. Position flight controls for existing wind conditions
	3. Soft-field takeoff
		1. Taxi into takeoff position without stopping, with [[Smooth Power Application|smooth power application]] for takeoff
		2. Establish pitch attitude to rapidly transfer weight from wheels to wings
		3. Lift off at lowest possible airspeed, accelerate to Vx or Vy in [[ground effect]]
		4. Establish pitch attitude and airspeed for Vx or Vy climb
		5. Retract gear/flaps after positive rate of climb, and in accordance with POH/AFM
	4. Short-field takeoff
		1. Taxi into takeoff position using maximum available runway length, and align on runway centerline
		2. Apply brakes and hold while applying takeoff power, check gauges
		3. Release brakes, accelerate with POH recommended pitch technique, rotate at recommended [[IAS]], and accelerate to and climb at Vx
		4. Retract gear/flaps after positive rate of climb, and in accordance with POH/AFM
		5. Maintain Vx until obstacle is cleared (or 50' AGL), then accelerate to Vy
3. Approach and Landing Procedures
	1. Complete pre-landing checklist
	2. Establish POH-recommended approach and landing configuration (flaps) and airspeed
	3. Soft-field landing
		1. Maintain stabilized approach and recommended airspeed (not more than 1.3Vso), applying gust factor ()
