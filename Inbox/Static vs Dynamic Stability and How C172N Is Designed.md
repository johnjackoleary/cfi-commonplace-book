## Stability
Stability is how an aircraft corrects (or doesn't correct) from disturbances. A disturbance may be a control input, such as pushing the yoke forward.

There are two key types of stability: static and dynamic.
- [[Static Stability]]: `= [[Static Stability]].definition`
- [[Dynamic Stability]]: `= [[Dynamic Stability]].definition`

Both stabilities can be further broken down.

### Types of Stability
#### Static Stability
In a single axis, an aircraft can have:
- Positive Static Stability: Initial tendency is to return to the original state.
- Neutral Static Stability: Initial tendency is to remain in new condition.
- Negative Static Stability: Initial tendency is to continue away from original state.

#### Dynamic Stability
Similarly, dynamic stability can be positive, neutral, or negative depending on if it converges to equilibrium, oscillates consistently, or diverges.

### Stability Around Each Axis
#### Longitudinal Stability
***Definition***: `= [[Longitudinal Stability]].definition`

The goal in [[longitudinal stability]] is to have the aircraft's nose return to safe flying attitude if a force pushes the nose up or down.

This is accomplished by having a [[CG]] forward of the [[CL]]

and how your airplane is designed. Should demonstrate knowledge of static stability (pos, neg, neutral), also [[Dihedral]] for [[Lateral Stability]] (5-17, 5-18 PHAK) and what helps with [[Longitudinal Stability]] 5-15 thru 17 PHAK) and [[Directional Stability]] 5-19 PHAK? (3)

Remember that a body free to rotate always turns about its [[CG]].
