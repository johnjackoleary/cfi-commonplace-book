# Key Takeaways
* Wind shear is a change in wind speed and/or direction over a short distance. 
* Four common sources of low-level wind shear are—
	1. Frontal activity.
	2. Thunderstorms.
	3. Temperature inversions.
	4. Surface obstructions.
1. Best ways a pilot can prevent a hazardous encounter with wind shear:
	- Know wind shear is there.
	- Know the magnitude of the change.
	- Be prepared to correct or go around immediately.

# Details
Wind shear is a change in wind speed and/or direction over a short distance. It can occur either horizontally or vertically and is most often associated with strong temperature inversions or density gradients.

While wind shear can occur at any altitude, low-level wind shear is especially hazardous due to the proximity of an aircraft to the ground.

Low-level wind shear is commonly associated with passing frontal systems, thunderstorms, temperature inversions, and strong upper level winds (greater than 25 knots).

## Microbursts
Microbursts are a very severe form of [[LLWS]].

The few visual clues are:
- An intense rain shaft at the surface but virga at cloud base
- A ring of blowing dust is often the only visible clue

A typical microburst:
- Has a horizontal diameter of 1–2 miles and a nominal depth of 1,000 feet. 
- Lasts about 5–15 minutes during 
- Can produce downdrafts of up to 6,000 feet per minute (fpm) and headwind losses of 30–90 knots
