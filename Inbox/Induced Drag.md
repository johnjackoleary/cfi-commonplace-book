Induced drag is a byproduct of generating lift. Anytime lift is generated, there is induced drag.

## Definition
***Definition***    :: Drag caused by the same factors that produce lift; its amount varies inversely with airspeed. As airspeed decreases, the angle of attack must increase, in turn increasing induced drag.
