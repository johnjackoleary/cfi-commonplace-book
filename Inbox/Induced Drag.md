## What Is It?
There are two main forms of drag on an aircraft: [[Parasite Drag]] and [[Induced Drag]].

Induced drag is a byproduct of generating lift. In fact, induced drag can be thought of as the rearward component of lift.

Anytime lift is generated, so is induced drag.

## What Causes It?
An airstream flowing over the wing generates lift perpendicular to the 

When air passes over a wing, it is deflected downward. That '[[downwash]]' changes the relative wind direction at the wing, causing

## What is the Impact to Flying?
Where parasite drag is most pronounced at faster speeds, induced drag is most pronounced as slow speeds.

### Cruise Speeds
At high speeds, induced drag drops significantly.

## Definition
***Definition***    :: Drag caused by the same factors that produce lift; its amount varies inversely with airspeed. As airspeed decreases, the angle of attack must increase, in turn increasing induced drag.
