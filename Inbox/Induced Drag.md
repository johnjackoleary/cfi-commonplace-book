## What Is It?
There are two main forms of drag on an aircraft: [[Parasite Drag]] and [[Induced Drag]].

Induced drag is a byproduct of generating lift. In fact, induced drag can be thought of as the rearward component of lift.

Anytime lift is generated, so is induced drag.

## What Causes It?
An airstream flowing over the wing generates lift perpendicular to the 

When air passes around a wing generating lift, it is deflected downward. (**Note**: Start video at 53 seconds.)

That deflected airstream, or '[[downwash]]', has the same effect as bending the lift vector rearward, creating a rearward lift component. This is induced drag.

A greater [[angle of attack]] for the same airspeed deflects the airflow more strongly, thus creating additional induced drag.

## What is the Impact to Flying?
Where parasite drag is most pronounced at faster speeds, induced drag is most pronounced as slow speeds.

### Cruise Speeds
At high speeds, induced drag drops significantly and is a negligible factor.

### Slow Flight
From [[PHAK Ch5]]:
> the lower the airspeed, the greater the AOA required to produce lift equal to the aircraftâ€™s weight and, therefore, the greater induced drag. The amount of induced drag varies inversely with the square of the airspeed.

## Definition
***Definition***    :: Drag caused by the same factors that produce lift; its amount varies inversely with airspeed. As airspeed decreases, the angle of attack must increase, in turn increasing induced drag.
