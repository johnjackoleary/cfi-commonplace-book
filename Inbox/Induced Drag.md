## What Is It?
There are two main forms of drag on an aircraft: [[Parasite Drag]] and [[Induced Drag]].

Induced drag is a byproduct of generating lift. In fact, induced drag can be thought of as the rearward component of lift.

Anytime lift is generated, so is induced drag.

## What Causes It?
An airstream flowing over the wing generates lift perpendicular to the relative airstream.

When air passes around a wing generating lift, that relative airstream is deflected downward. (**Note**: Start video at 53 seconds.)

That deflected airstream, or '[[downwash]]', has the same effect as bending the lift vector rearward, creating a rearward lift component. This is induced drag.

## What is the Impact to Flying?
Where parasite drag is most pronounced at faster speeds, induced drag is most pronounced as slow speeds.

### Cruise Speeds
At high speeds, induced drag drops significantly and is a negligible factor.

### Slow Flight
From [[PHAK Ch5]]:
> the lower the airspeed, the greater the AOA required to produce lift equal to the aircraftâ€™s weight and, therefore, the greater induced drag. The amount of induced drag varies inversely with the square of the airspeed.

This is why the aircraft requires so much power to maintain slow flight, and why it can actually fly faster with less power as you accelerate to a speed with less induced drag.

### Flight in Ground Effect
[[Ground effect]] changes the airflow of the downwash, since the hard runway surface does not allow the airflow to bend as much. This mean the lift vector does not tip backward as much, and there is less induced drag.

This impact to ground effect is why it's important to rotate and climb out at the [[POH]] recommended speed during takeoff.

It is also the reason the airplane cane feel like it suddenly wants to float as you approach to land.

## What About Wingtip Vortices?
Wingtip vortices are created by the higher pressure air below the wing rushing around the end of the wing to the lower pressure air above the wing. This creates a vortex.

Wingtip vortices increase downwash, therefore further tipping the lift vector backwards and increasing the rearward component of lift. This rearward component of lift is induced drag, meaning wingtip vortices increase induced drag.

Wingtip vortex development is also interrupted in ground effect, further contributing to the reduction in induced drag near the ground.

## FAA Definition
***Definition***    :: Drag caused by the same factors that produce lift; its amount varies inversely with airspeed. As airspeed decreases, the angle of attack must increase, in turn increasing induced drag.
