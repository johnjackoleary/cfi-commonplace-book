## What Is It?
There are two main forms of drag on an aircraft: [[Parasite Drag]] and [[Induced Drag]].

Induced drag is a byproduct of generating lift. Anytime lift is generated, there is induced drag.

## What Causes It?


## What is the Impact to Flying?
Where parasite drag is most pronounced at faster speeds, induced drag is most pronounced as slow speeds.

This means 

## How is it mitigated?




## Definition
***Definition***    :: Drag caused by the same factors that produce lift; its amount varies inversely with airspeed. As airspeed decreases, the angle of attack must increase, in turn increasing induced drag.
