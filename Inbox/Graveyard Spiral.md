***Definition***    :: While similar to [[The Leans]], a graveyard spiral adds the additional illusion of being in a level descent, since altitude is being lost, when actually the vertical component of lift is being reduced by the bank. The unsuspecting pilot may pull back on the controls to stop the descent, which instead tightens the spiral and increases altitude loss.
***Mitigation***: Be aware of this illusion, and trust your instruments.
