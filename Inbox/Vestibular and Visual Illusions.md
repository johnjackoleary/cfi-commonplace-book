Our body relies on the [[vestibular system]], [[somatosensory system]], and [[visual system]] to 


• Somatosensory system—nerves in the skin, muscles, and joints that, along with hearing, sense position based on gravity, feeling, and sound
• Visual system—eyes, which sense position based on what is seen
