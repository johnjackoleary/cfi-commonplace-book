# Overview
> the left turning tendency of the airplane is made up of four elements that cause or produce a twisting or rotating motion around at least one of the airplane’s three axes

# Four Tendencies
## Torque Reaction
> Torque reaction involves Newton’s Third Law of Physics— for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. As applied to the aircraft, this means that as the internal engine parts and propeller are revolving in one direction, an equal force is trying to rotate the aircraft in the opposite direction.

### Impact
During cruise flight, the aircraft is designed to negate this.

During takeoff roll, however, this can be felt as a left turn. Since the clockwise propeller forces the left tire harder to the ground, causing more friction and making the airplane pivot left.

### Mitigation
Use right rudder as needed to align with centerline on takeoff roll.

## Spiral Slipstream
> The high-speed rotation of an aircraft propeller gives a corkscrew or spiraling rotation to the slipstream. At high propeller speeds and low forward speed (as in the takeoffs and approaches to power-on stalls), this spiraling rotation is very compact and exerts a strong sideward force on the aircraft’s vertical tail surface.

### Impact
Slipstream striking the vertical fin, especially as slow speeds, yaws the nose left.

At faster speeds, the slipstream elongates and is not as impactful.
