But, once the airplane is stalled, this effect reverses itself! When one wing goes down and thus increases its Angle of Attack, it thereby finds no cushion of new lift, but on the contrary it destroys even more of its own lift and keeps wanting to go down. At the same time the other wing, in going up, reduces its Angle of Attack and may thereby actually unstall itself, gain lift, and keep wanting to go up! Thus a stalled airplane is laterally unstable and undamped; the more a wing drops, the more it wants to drop.
