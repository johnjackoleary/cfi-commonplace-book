Operational pitfalls can be categorized under the following: 

- **Peer Pressure**: “Come on, don’t be a chicken, you can totally do that.”
- **Mind Set**: Inability to cope with changes and fixating on the original goal. 
- **Operating without visual line of sight (VLOS)**: Losing VLOS in order to complete the mission without having to move. 
- **Getting behind the aircraft:** a constant state of surprise at what happens next. 
- **Loss of situational awareness**: not knowing where you are or what/who is around you. 
- **Operating past the battery/fuel warning**: Ignoring low battery/fuel warnings and forcing the aircraft to land in an emergency. 
- **Operate above maximum authorized altitude**: ignoring LAANC altitudes or flying higher than 400 feet AGL. 
- **Neglect for planning, inspections and checklists**:  relying on short or long -term memory or over-trusting the equipment.
