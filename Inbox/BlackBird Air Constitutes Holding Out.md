***Key Quotes***:
* pilots participating in BlackBird's platform and using its app are [[holding out]] and thus are engaged in [[common carriage]]
* Because these operations are subject to [[part 119]] certification, a pilot who holds an [[airline transport pilot]] or [[commercial pilot]] certificate must obtain and hold a certificate issued under [[part 135]] or the pilot must be employed by a company operating the flight that is certificated under part 119.
