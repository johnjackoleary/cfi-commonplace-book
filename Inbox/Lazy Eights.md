## Lazy Eights

**Objective:** The lazy eight is a maneuver that is designed to develop the proper coordination of the flight controls across a wide range of airspeeds and attitudes.
**References:** [[AFH Chap10]], [[Commercial ACS]]
**Builds On:** [[Performance Maneuvers - Ground Reference Maneuvers]]
**Schedule:** 
**Lesson Elements:**
1. How to think about a lazy eight
	1. Similar to an S-Turn, a lazy eight is two or more opposing 180° turns. The lazy eight adds both a climb and descent to each 180° segment (first 90° is the climb, the second 90° is the descent).
	2. A lazy eight 
2. Maneuver setup
	1. Clear the area.
	2. Select an altitude that will allow the maneuver to be performed no lower than 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL).
	3. Be careful of overlaying Bravo.
	4. Establish the recommended entry configuration, power, and airspeed. (See aircraft specific maneuver sheets, e.g. [[cfi_maneuvers_cessna_172.pdf]])
3. Maneuver
	1. Pick reference point off wing in direction of turn, 
	2. Constant change of pitch and roll rate and airspeed throughout.
	3. Should be ~30° bank at the steepest point.
	4. ‡ At the 180° point, **±100 feet from entry altitude, ±10 knots from entry airspeed, ±10° from heading**.

**Completion Standards:** Client must fly maneuver to [[ACS]] standards: 
- Approximately 30° bank at the steepest point.
- Constant change of pitch and roll rate and airspeed.
- At the 180° point: ±100 feet from entry altitude, ±10 knots from entry airspeed, ±10° from heading.
