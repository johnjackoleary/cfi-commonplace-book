Grady v aero-tech servs 2021

Question is what is the duty of the flight instructor? And did what he did qualify as educational malpractice 

If you breathe it as a CFI, write it in the logbook 

Reasonable person standard. What would a reasonable prudent flight school teach? If no specific standard, nothing to hold them to. Eg in Grady 

Interesting that dpe chekcikg logbook really does protect the CFI




Questions:
- mx shops carrying less insurance 
- Why wasnâ€™t the DPE sued?
	- Makes sense, might be next test case. But in medical examiners only a big problem for Santa Claus DPEs 
- Worry about over documenting?
- Students with hazardous attitudes?
