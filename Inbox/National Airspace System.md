# Key Takeaways
- The US uses class A, B, C, D, E, G airspace, listed from most to least restrictive.
- All except Class G are controlled airspace.
- Class D airspace may revert to Class E or G when the tower is closed.

# Details
## Overview
All airspace in the US is classified depending on its uses. These classes carry with them certain restrictions, including things like equipment required and minimum weather allowed for VFR flight.

Each airspace has a different purpose and definition of it's size and shape. See the [[AIM 3]] for more details on this.

## Distinctions Between Classes
From [[PHAK Ch15]]:
> [!quote]
> The categories and types of airspace are dictated by the complexity or density of aircraft movements, nature of the operations conducted within the airspace, the level of safety required, and national and public interest.

### Controlled Airspace
From [[PHAK Ch15]]:
> [!quote]
> Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within which air traffic control (ATC) service is provided in accordance with the airspace classification.

This includes Class A, B, C, D, E.

### Uncontrolled Airspace
This is simply airspace not designated as class A, B, C, D, or E.

ATC has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic there, but VFR weather minimums still apply.

> [!tip]
> Some Class D airports may revert to either a Class E or Class G when the tower is closed.

### Special Use Airspace
- Prohibited areas: Flight prohibited (e.g. White House)
- Restricted areas: Not prohibited, but has restrictions
- Warning areas: Similar to restricted, but not solely US jurisdiction (e.g. over ocean)
- Military operation areas ([[MOA]]s)
- Alert areas: Use caution for high volume of pilot training or unusual aerial activities
- Controlled firing areas ([[CFA]]s): Not charted, as activities suspended when aircraft spotted

### Other Airspace
Other airspaces also exist, e.g. near Livermore over the research lab. Make sure to check for these before you fly!
