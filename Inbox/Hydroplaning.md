# Key Takeaways
- Risk on runway surfaces contaminated with standing water, slush, or wet snow
- Can render an airplane partially or totally uncontrollable during landing roll
- Grooved runways can help prevent hydroplaning

> [!danger] If deceleration is not detected and hydroplaning is suspected...
> Raise the nose and use aerodynamic drag to decelerate to a point where the brakes become effective

***Definition***    :: A condition that exists when landing on a surface with standing water deeper than the tread depth of the tires. When the brakes are applied, there is a possibility that the brake will lock up and the tire will ride on the surface of the water, much like a water ski. When the tires are hydroplaning, directional control and braking action are virtually impossible. An effective anti-skid system can minimize the effects of hydroplaning.
