When an engine quits — and won't restart — the next step is an emergency landing. There are three types of off-airport landings. [[Precautionary landing]]s are made with power in anticipation of a real emergency. [[Forced landing]]s are made with a dead engine. And a [[ditching]] is a forced landing in water.

The important distinction between the three is their fatality rates. The rate for precautionary landings is 0.06 percent. If you recognize a developing engine problem and can make a precautionary landing, you and your passengers will likely survive. The fatality rate for forced landings is roughly 10 percent, more than 1,600 times greater than precautionary landings. Ditchings have the worst rate, about 20 percent.
