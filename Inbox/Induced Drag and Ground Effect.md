#### Summary
* Local relative wind bends down at higher [[AOA]], and so [[lift]] vector is redirected slightly backwards. The portion of lift redirected rearward is induced drag.
* When near the runway, the local relative airstream can't bend as much, because the runway is there and is a hard surface, so the lift vector doesn't get sent backwards as much. (Induced drag disappears or diminishes in [[ground effect]].)
* "Lift that acts like drag is known as [[Induced Drag]]"
