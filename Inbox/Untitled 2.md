Personal minimums. Most pilots understand 
it is not intelligent to do "zero-zero" take-off. I 
teach my IFR students that my personal 
minimum is the ceiling and visibility that will 
allow a safe return to the departure airport (or a 
nearby departure alternative). When the 
student was a low-time IFR pilot, I advised her 
to raise the minimum to either a non-precision 
level or a circling minimum level to depart that 
airport.
