When drag exceeds thrust, (T – D < 0), the airplane's total mechanical energy decreases. The pilot has two sources of stored energy to 
tap into. For example, the pilot may choose to let the airplane descend at a constant airspeed [Figure 4-1C)] or slow down while 
maintaining altitude [Figure 4-1D] as stored energy is withdrawn to deal with the energy deficit. When energy gained equals that lost 
(T – D = 0), all thrust is spent on drag
