***Definition***    :: The pivotal altitude is the altitude at which, for a given groundspeed, the projection of the visual reference line to the pylon appears to pivot. Visually, a taut string, if extended from the pilot's eyes to the pylon, would remain parallel to lateral axis as the airplane makes a turn around the pylon.
