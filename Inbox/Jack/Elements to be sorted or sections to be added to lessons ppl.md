#todo :: Make sure these elements are all addressed in syllabus

Lots pulled into [[PPL.17 Pre-Solo Knowledge Test and Review]]

![[Vx vs Vy at Higher Altitudes.jpeg]]

Figure out if airport lighting should be grouped with markings/wind indicators (from [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]] and [[PPL.18 Non-Towered Airport Operations]]) into a whole new lesson

Purchase current FAR/AIM

* Perhaps calculate the expected descent rate in pattern legs as well, and figure out RPM from there?
* standard images for drawing on
* static port
* fuel burn and MIXTURE setting
* Don't do all of pre-flight briefing all at once, some elements in each and build up over time
* always use full n number for early lessons (update comms example)

- always use full n number for early lessons (update comms example)
- talk about crosswind component for takeof
- trailing edge of wing? how to describe start of stall spreading
- - does sim use magnetic heading?

Better way to explain parasitic and induced drag. ground effect.

Emergencies with instrument failures (e.g. what if pitot tube is covered)

When to take off with tailwind

rate of turn vs bank angle

aircraft systems (perhaps as a required reading, then ask questions of student?)

- true and magnetic (and if we should talk winds aloft)
	- include some resources on magnetic and true north
	- resources also for use in Sim


Regulation about attitude of aircraft

Talk about the different V speeds, per FlyingTrd request

slips and skids

propellers

3. Before Takeoff Check
	1. [[CIGAR TIP]] acronym
		1. #todo :: may be better to teach rope knot as part of a future lesson

Flight instruments

Airport, Runway, and Taxiway lights

Lost communication procedures.

wing washout?

demonstration stalls?
