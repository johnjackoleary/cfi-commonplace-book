A reliable adage that reminds the pilot encountering a stressful situation to turn his/her attention first to flying the plane.  **Aviate**.  Keeping the plane in the air while controlling speed and attitude is the most important task.

Once that goal is achieved, the pilot should turn attention to **Navigation**-- taking the plane in the right direction or toward the right destination.

Finally, **Communicate**.  Use the radio to keep ATC appraised of your position and situation, and to get assistance.

A classic mistake, for example, would be to let radio work distract you enough so that you end up in an unusual attitude that needs recovery.
