You can add an instrument rating to a [[PPL]] license based on [[FAR 61.75 PPL Cert from Foreign License|FAR 61.75]].


It sounds like the foreign-based license basically means you’ll need to get a new verification letter for each checkride (which can take a while!)

The other big drawback is needing to keep your foreign license current. But if you’ll do that anyway, no big deal. (Plus when you get to CPL, you’d replace your foreign PPL and it’s a non-issue.)

At least, this seems to be how this works
