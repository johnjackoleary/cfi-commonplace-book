“Now, one of the best pieces of advice I've heard about this kind of situation is that as pilots, we should never decide ahead of time which taxiway we will use to exit the runway.
Instead, do a normal landing with normal braking and only after you've slowed to a speed at which you can turn then, and only then, decide which taxiway to exit on. And if the plane behind you has to go around, whose fault is that? It's certainly not your fault if the plane behind you didn't do a good job of spacing himself out behind you and that had to go around because you're still on the runway.”
