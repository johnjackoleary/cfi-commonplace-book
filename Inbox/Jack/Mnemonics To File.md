[[CIGAR TIP]] as a before-takeoff check:
-   Controls free and correct
-   Instruments read correctly
-   Gas sufficient for flight and proper tank selected for takeoff
-   Angle of flaps
-   Run-up magneto, carb heat, and propeller checks as appropriate
-   Trim set
-   Interior set: Seat belts, doors and windows latched
-   Pattern checked for other aircraft.

If you’re an instrument pilot, you probably remember the four-, five- or six “T”s (depending on your airplane) for crossing a fix:
-   Turn
-   Time
-   Tune (radios) 
-   Tires (gear down as appropriate) 
-   Throttle
-   Talk (report to ATC)
> Note: Lou has a different meaning for these, specifically no 'tires' and tune/twist

Another frequently used for landing is [[GUMPS]] :
-   Gas set to the proper tank for landing
-   Undercarriage (landing gear) down and locked
-   Mixture set
-   Propeller set
-   Switches (fuel pumps, etc.) set as appropriate, and safety check (seatbelts, etc)
