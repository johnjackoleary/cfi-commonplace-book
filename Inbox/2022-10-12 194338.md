“He told me that mana was the Hawaiian word for “spirit” or “spiritual power” or “energy.” If there needs to be a reason for surfing, mana is the reason, he said. “Surfing is about managing energy.” He described the ocean as a pure analog, a graph, of energy patterns. And I began to realize how sophisticated his knowledge had become, this part-time lifeguard who made a living doing odd jobs while his wife sewed baby clothes. Who made do in order to surf. “Sometimes I see a surfer out there,” Mike said, “and he’s got his timing just right, coming down the face of a wave, and when he comes back in, he walks by me on the beach, and I can just feel the mana coming off him in waves as he goes past. It’s spooky. Surfing is a very spiritual thing.””
