Way of breaking up TAF assessments for around Bay

—

Hey Riley, what do you think about the weather for our flight tomorrow? Check out the TAFs at SFO, OAK, SJC, and LVK to build a picture of the different conditions around the bay.

We’d want ceilings of at least 1500’ to do pattern work (technically 1300’ gives us 500’ clearance below clouds at TPA for SQL, but in practice I find less than 1500’ is pushing it, and even that is pretty low). Gusty conditions are not preferred, but workable. We could go to SQL, PAO, HAF, HWD, OAK, or LVK. (note: getting to LVK requires higher ceilings over Sunol since we’ll cross the ridge there.)

I don’t recall if we talked about 4G as a backup, but we could do that for ground instead of a flight as well.

Send me your thoughts on if we should plan to keep the flight, and if so, where you’d like to go. I’ll send my take on the weather in hidden text as well, in case you don’t see this before the morning.
