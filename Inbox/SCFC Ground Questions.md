1. What makes lift?
	1. Newton
	2. Bernoulli
2. What is [[Density Altitude]]? (Not how you calculate it!)
	1. Pressure altitude corrected for non-standard tempurature
	2. What the plane thinks it's flying
	3. `= [[Density Altitude]].definition`
3. What are the units of Density Altitude?
	1. feet
4. What factors affect Density Altitude?
		1. High, Hot, Humid
5. What is [[Pressure Altitude]]?
	1. Indicated altitude when altimeter is set to 29.92"hg
	2. `= [[Pressure Altitude]].definition`
6. What are the units of Pressure Altitude?
	1. feet
7. If automated weather at the airport reports altimeter setting 29.84, what exactly does that mean?
	1. This is the local barometric pressure at the airport, literally the weight of the atmosphere over the airport
	2. This is below standard pressure (29.92), and so part of a low pressure system
8. If an aircraft flies from an area that is 15° warmer than standard to an area that is only 5° warmer than standard, how does the altimeter read? (too high, too low, or correctly)
	1. High to low (pressure), look out below
	2. Hot to cold (temp), look out below
9. What is [[Load Factor]]?
	1. `= [[Load Factor]].definition`
10. How can you describe load factor as a formula using only the four fundamental forces?
	1. n = L/W
11. What is induced drag?
	1. `=[[Induced Drag]].definition`
12. In what flight conditions is induced drag dramatically reduced?
	1. Ground effect and higher speeds
13. How does [[Weight]] impact fuel burn?
	1. See [[Weight]]
14. Why does the airplane have a limit to how high it can fly?
	1. High altitudes require higher speed to generate the same lift. This higher sped requires more thrust, and eventually the aircraft engine will not be able to output the thrust required to generate additional lift.
15. How do V​X​ and V​Y​ change with altitude?
	1. Vx moves closer to Vy (increases), and Vy closer to Vx. At absolute ceiling, they are equal
16. How does V​A​ change with weight? Why?
17. Using an aeronautical chart, locate a point in the country where the floor of Class Echo airspace is found at
	1. 1,200 ft AGL.
	2. 700 ft AGL.
	3. the surface.
	4. 14,500 ft MSL.
	5. some other elevation.
18. What inflight weather minima must be met to operate an airplane at VFR at 500 ft AGL in
	1. Class B airspace?
	2. Class C airspace?
	3. Class E airspace?
	4. Class G airspace?
19. What causes the four effects known as “left-turning tendencies” and when do they act?
20. When viewed by someone on the ground, what would a stabilized approach look like, sound like?
