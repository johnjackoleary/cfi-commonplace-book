## Pre-solo maneuvers from [[FAR 61.87]]
A student pilot who is receiving training for a single-engine airplane rating or privileges must receive and log flight training for the following maneuvers and procedures: 

(1) Proper flight preparation procedures, including preflight planning and preparation, powerplant operation, and aircraft systems; 

(2) Taxiing or surface operations, including runups; 

(3) Takeoffs and landings, including normal and crosswind; 

(4) Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions; 

(5) Climbs and climbing turns; 

(6) Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures; 

(7) Collision avoidance, windshear avoidance, and wake turbulence avoidance; 

(8) Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations; 

(9) Flight at various airspeeds from cruise to slow flight; 

(10) Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall; 

(11) Emergency procedures and equipment malfunctions; 

(12) Ground reference maneuvers; 

(13) Approaches to a landing area with simulated engine malfunctions; 

(14) Slips to a landing; and 

(15) Go-arounds.
