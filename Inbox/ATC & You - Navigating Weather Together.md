A #lecture at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|Oshkosh]] 2025 by [[NATCA]].

1. [[TRACON]] and [[ARTCC]] can only see precipitation, not generic buildup.
2. [[ATC]] has an on-site meteorologist. 
3. Controllers get a full [[weather brief]] before they start each shift.
4. Feel free to ask in plain English if you don’t know proper phraseology. Don’t hesitate to ask.
5. [[PIREP]]s can be just a quick heads up to them, don’t stress the format too much. 
6. Give PIREPs of anything you would have liked to know. They'll pass it on to the next pilots.
7. Declaring the emergency: if you declare, they are also allowed to break any rule to help get you safe. Sort of like an ATC version of [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority|91.3]].

Pic of when they’re required to ask for PIREPs 



Average of 178 seconds until bad outcome with VFR into IM 

90% of accidents resulting from thunderstorms are fatal

Can request block altitude if unable to hold altitude in turbulence 

Idea: icing simulation to demo rate and type?

Icing layers are rarely more than 3000’ thick 

Include ATC in your CRM

Can email askATC@natca.org

Giving you direct or shortcuts is also something ATC wants to do, no need to ask for this. They want you through their airspace faster as well 

Not uncommon to get a new squawk code because there’s just not that many codes available, can’t have two planes with the same code 

Questions for them:
- these videos available?
	- Maybe, ask PR person or send email to it
- What’s the extent you can discourage a pilot decision?
	- Cant really do anything, but will paint a vivid picture 

Questions for John:
- filing IFR circuits
	- Leg by leg 
- Filing to VFR on top
	- Just file to a destination you can actually go to so you have a full IFR plan if you need it
- best to ask “VFR request”?
	- Just call sign is enough to get a code
	- TRACON has internal codes
- Turn off the radio in emergency?
- Pop up IFR etiquette and timing
