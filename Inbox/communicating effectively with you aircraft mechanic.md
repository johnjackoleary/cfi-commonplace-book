Book engine management 101

A&P is also a license to learn

Ask:
- do you have current technical data for my engine?
- Do you have current technical data for my aircraft?
- No excuse for not having it

Could buy the technical data for the mechanic as a group of owners of a similar aircraft

Calibrated equipment:
- torqued wretches
- Gages
- Others


Do you lycoming/etc training?


Questions:
- Different mechanics for different types of work?
	- Yes very normal
- Other mechanic sees things missed by previous mechanic 
- What does it mean to have an uncalibrated torque wrench?

Torque: can think of a bolt as like a spring being stretched
