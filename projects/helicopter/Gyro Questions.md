- Traffic displays?
- How to manage cockpit for things like charts?
- Tie down or rotor blade for this model?
- Night flight equipped?
- What models do you sell and how do you pitch the differences?
- AvGas UL91? Is that car gas? Is that what you recommend using?
- How practical is it to remove doors for flight? Easy to do? Bad fuel economy?
- How often do you find you're canceling flights for weather? Especially compared to how often you're canceling compared to ASEL
- Why AutoGyro and not the othe big companies (Magni and ELA)
- Can we look at the three certificated models? Can I sit in them?
- Rotax 914 vs 915 (30 hp differnce and fuel injected), extra horsepower of 914/915 might be nice for hot or high areas. Longer warranty on 915 starting in august 


Flying Experience:
- Cam we see the lag people talk about in control inputs of gyroplane 
- Go around decision timings are apparently tricky?
- How big a concern are pilot induced oscillations?
- Buntover concerns? How to think about?
- Folks say it handles turbulence well, what does that mean?
- Practical landing on grass?
- Water versions for lake landings?
- Big side slip warnings in POH! What's that about?
- How noisy is it to people below?
- What do you tell people with safety concerns?


Training:
- Recommended certificate path? Could I take passengers? (Sport pilot and LDA)
- Do you offer a training discount for people purchasing? (Talk to mark, nothing standard)


Personal use:
- Best for cross country? For touring? Why?
- Could I fly it back to Minnesota with my dog?
- How does it handle the cold? Like Minnesota winters?

Professional use:
- Could I use it for instructing? Rentals?
- Is teaching current fixed or heli folks hard? 
- Which models best for teaching? Why?
- Dropping parachutist is USA allowed?
- Sounds like there's a pretty active gyro movement around US and world. Have you found that useful? Where do you see things going in the next 5 years?
- Have you worked with iapgt? Thoughts on the group / program?


Operations and Cost:
- What does maintenance look like? What about maintenance costs? (16 hours labor on annual, maybe $400 for spark plugs) (rotor damage can be expensive)
