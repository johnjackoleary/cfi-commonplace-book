From Nader: San Carlos Flight Center _formerly_ did provide helicopter instruction (circa 2015).  The helicopters are still around in the Bay Area, but not at SCFC anymore.

- Seacoast Helicopters has worked with Great Bay Community College, located on the Pease International Tradeport just down the street from his office, to create a helicopter pilot training program that took 18 months to put together. The business also offers private flight training, does the scenic tours business in the summer, and brings maintenance personnel to remote locations where government-owned towers are often located.

- How much would stuarts investment save?
	- Likely a R44: ~$475k -- $555k new (see [[Robinson Configurator.pdf]]), maybe ~$300k [used](https://www.controller.com/listings/for-sale/robinson/r44/piston-helicopters/5)
	- Hangar tug / wheels?
	- Hangar
		- [PAO hangar waitlist](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/Departments/Public-Works/Palo-Alto-Airport/Airport-FAQs) is $500 deposit
			- Although this [seems to be for](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/files/assets/public/public-works/palo-alto-airport/city-hangar-leasing-policy.pdf) non-commercial hangars
		- Size based on [POH](https://robinsonheli.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/r44_poh_full_book.pdf) = 459" by 83", 129" tall
			- Could fit in any hangar from POH: https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/files/assets/public/public-works/palo-alto-airport/hangar-dimensions-final.pdf
	- Business space in PAO: 
		- Commercial Operations Fee: [$120.00 per year](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/files/assets/public/public-works/palo-alto-airport/palo-alto-airport-_-fy-2017-pao-schedule-of-fees-and-charges.pdf)

		- PDF is messed up, but https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/files/assets/public/public-works/palo-alto-airport/palo-alto-airport-layout-plan-faa-approval-set.pdf seems like an ok start

	- But they run the business the right way. Employees are treated like family. They had an abundance of parts on hand (including big ticket items like blades and a RR 250-C20). They own all of the aircraft, a pristine hangar and some extremely valuable commercial property. Maintenance was top notch. The general manager was very approachable and always had my back. Truly can't say enough positive things about them. No doubt it was tough for them starting out, but they had the integrity, knowledge and experience to do things the right way. Many new business owners don't. 
	- It ended with only having one helicopter in service (which was leased) and me being the only pilot. Knowing that if you call out sick, or any unscheduled maintenance comes up, will cut a failing company's revenue completely off is a miserable situation to be in. I promised myself I would never work for a company like that again.

Areas of concern:
- what if helicopter goes down for maintenance?
- What if pilot gets sick?
- Can business scale?
- Can business grow?
