From Nader: San Carlos Flight Center _formerly_ did provide helicopter instruction (circa 2015).  The helicopters are still around in the Bay Area, but not at SCFC anymore.

My first search was "helicopter lessons bay area"

	- I like this way of talking about cost: https://www.specializedheli.com/flight-training-costs
- https://www.helicopteracademy.com/helicopter-training-location-san-francisco-california (concord airport)
- https://av8aviation.com/contact/ (sacremento) - discovery flight $250, 30 min ground, 30 min air
- http://www.bayhelicoptours.com/training.html (pretty depressing FAQs for a transition)

- Faralon  island tours
- Scuba related..?
- Stranded pilot services -- could sell as insurance to clubs in the area
- VTOL training programs 
- Seacoast Helicopters has worked with Great Bay Community College, located on the Pease International Tradeport just down the street from his office, to create a helicopter pilot training program that took 18 months to put together. The business also offers private flight training, does the scenic tours business in the summer, and brings maintenance personnel to remote locations where government-owned towers are often located.

- Could build each tour custom with input from passengers (custom meaning from a roughly preselected list)
- Teaching heli students
- Geology tours of bay, or other types of tours in connection with Stanford 
- Drone instructor/ lessons?
- Host fly ins for each tour (if they can get my location over adsb?), and use that as global word of mouth marketing
- Helicopter mini lessons for pilots, not to get a certificate but to learn basics and be better at working with helis
- Teaching actors how to fly enough for movie

	- But they run the business the right way. Employees are treated like family. They had an abundance of parts on hand (including big ticket items like blades and a RR 250-C20). They own all of the aircraft, a pristine hangar and some extremely valuable commercial property. Maintenance was top notch. The general manager was very approachable and always had my back. Truly can't say enough positive things about them. No doubt it was tough for them starting out, but they had the integrity, knowledge and experience to do things the right way. Many new business owners don't. 
	- It ended with only having one helicopter in service (which was leased) and me being the only pilot. Knowing that if you call out sick, or any unscheduled maintenance comes up, will cut a failing company's revenue completely off is a miserable situation to be in. I promised myself I would never work for a company like that again.

- what if helicopter goes down for maintenance?
- What if pilot gets sick?
- Can business scale?
- Can business grow?
