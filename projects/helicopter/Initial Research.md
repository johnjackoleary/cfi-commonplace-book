The business also offers private flight training, does the scenic tours business in the summer, and brings maintenance personnel to remote locations where government-owned towers are often located.

	- Hangar
		- [PAO hangar waitlist](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/Departments/Public-Works/Palo-Alto-Airport/Airport-FAQs) is $500 deposit

	- But they run the business the right way. Employees are treated like family. They had an abundance of parts on hand (including big ticket items like blades and a RR 250-C20). They own all of the aircraft, a pristine hangar and some extremely valuable commercial property. Maintenance was top notch. The general manager was very approachable and always had my back. Truly can't say enough positive things about them. No doubt it was tough for them starting out, but they had the integrity, knowledge and experience to do things the right way. Many new business owners don't. 
	- It ended with only having one helicopter in service (which was leased) and me being the only pilot. Knowing that if you call out sick, or any unscheduled maintenance comes up, will cut a failing company's revenue completely off is a miserable situation to be in. I promised myself I would never work for a company like that again.
- Consider contacting sea coast helicopters

- What if pilot gets sick?
- Can business scale?
- Can business grow?

Regultory:

	-  Helicopter operators must be equipped with fixed floats or an inflatable flotation system if the over-water flight is conducted beyond power-off gliding distance to the shoreline.
	-  small air tour operators who stay within 25 statute miles of their departure point should be able to continue to fly under Part 91 instead of being forced to operate under much more expensive Part 135 regulations.
