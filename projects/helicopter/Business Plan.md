This plan assumes
- a helicopter (R44) will be purchased as an initial investment.
- commercial hangar space will be found at KPAO.

A section has also been included to examine deviation from those assumptions.

## Value Add
Aviation is a notably expensive pastime to partake in, both for training and ongoing particiation.

### Training Costs
To help combat this the FAA has created a number of programs, including the Sport Pilot program, to help individuals wishing to fly without the significant time commitment of a full Private Pilots License. These individuals are also limited in the conditions under which they can fly, to primarily good daytime conditions.

They have also expanded the options for training to more classes of aircraft, meaning a fixed wing student can apply hours from rotercraft, and vice versa. A common example of this is completing long flights in a light aircraft (e.g. Cessna 152), to build hours without the significant operating costs of more techincally advanced or powerful aircraft.

### Ongoing Participation
Operating (or even owning) and aircraft is an expensive hobby, and often options are limited for a reasonable cost. Further, since many aircraft are owned for distance travel, a simple sight-seeing or joy flight often pays a large premium to use an aircraft that is overly complex or high-powered.

For those looking to travel cross country, fixed wing aircraft are a great option. But for those looking for low-and-slow or short hops, they are very expensive both in operating and maintenance.

## Intended Market
Gyroplanes are a particular market, since they are slower (speeds like a trainer airplane) and only have two seats. However, they are perfect for those training to fly, those looking for a less expensive joy ride, and those who love to see an area from the sky.

This company is aimed at individuals who are just looking for fly for much cheaper than a fixed-wing aircraft rental could provide.

## Opportunities to Pivot
This company, as it iterates and works with more students, will be teaching a unique style of aviation. They require slightly different methods to fly, and therefore different methods to teach (especially with an emphasis on transitioning from helicopters or airplanes to gyroplanes).

This puts the company in a prime position to partner with eVTOL and other electric aircraft companies in the coming years. These companies are working to perfect new aircraft technology, which will require the resources, experience, and connections to integrate in the modern aviation life.

Furthermore, since these technologies (both eVTOL and early electric planes) will have similar use cases and constraints to gyroplanes, the client based established will be a valuable asset in negotiating with these companies.

In short, if the need or desire to pivot from gyroplanes did arise, this company is well positioned to reuse all assets that could not be directly resold.
