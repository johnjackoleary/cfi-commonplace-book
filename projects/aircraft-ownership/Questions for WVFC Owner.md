I'm not sure these questions even make sense, and I'll just use this conversation as a starting point, not guarantees or anything.
- Which plane do you own? (May be able to look this up)
- Is buying this to reduce training costs even the right way to think about it? Or is it more like an investment? 
- Knowing you use this in part to teach, are you able to write off a purchase like this as a business expense? What about maintenance? What about when you rent other planes from the club, eg for current practice or new ratings?
- Did you set up an LLC to purchase this? Do you use the same company for CFI business?
- Iâ€™ve heard both the DA40 and Citabria are great planes for the club, because they are just about at critical mass and so should be rented pretty regularly. Do you have an estimate on how many hours I could expect each of these planes to fly?
- Are there policy documents I can reference from the club about ownership? For instance, I would like to use the DA40 (if I go that route) for long trips back to the midwest occasionally. How does cost-per-hour work as the owner? What about non-flying day rates?
- Could I teach using the plane if a student was not part of the club?
- Any advice on who to work with for setting up company and that part of the equation?
- Any advice on where to find used planes?
