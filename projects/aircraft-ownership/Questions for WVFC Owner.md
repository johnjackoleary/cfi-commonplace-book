I'm not sure these questions even make sense, and I'll just use this conversation as a starting point, not guarantees or anything.

Talking to James Sloan
- Goals
	- Learning
		- Also helps with teaching from a different perspective
	- Offsetting costs
- Which plane do you own?
	- C-172SPG1
- Long distance travel
	- Getting to minneapolis would be a huge pain, pretty far
		- Still expensive
- If citabria is with flight school, they'll want you to overhaul the engine at TBO
	- Perhaps advantage doesn't need this though
- Is buying this to reduce training costs even the right way to think about it? Or is it more like an investment?
- Knowing you use this in part to teach, are you able to write off a purchase like this as a business expense? What about maintenance? What about when you rent other planes from the club, eg for current practice or new ratings?
	- Acquire material or enhances skills in existing profession, but can't deduct for profession you're moving to
	- So commercial may qualify you for a new trade, but then CFI and beyond can be deducted potentailly (cost of training and cost of airplane)
	- Probably need to allocate use to personal, business use, and training
	- AOPA has a bit of a legal service
		- Can also work with Calidforian licensed panel attoerny
		- Several number of free hours per month
	- Can also research online and read law firms publications, etc
- Did you set up an LLC to purchase this? Do you use the same company for CFI business?
	- Talk to panel attorney about this
	- Correct vehicle for protection is insurance
		- Two important scenarios
			- You flying airplane, and you did something dumb, and you crash
			- You rent plane to flight school, and someone has an issue
				- Flight school to get sued likely first, but you might get sued. Then you need to make sure enough insurance to cover that sort of event
				- LLC might protect you, but hard to do in single member LLC
					- LLC costs $800 per year with the state
					- Might be useful if with a partner
	- So no LLC as a CFI, just keep track of accounting
	- Having an LLC has been useful for business registration with the state, good for learning in some ways
		- Actually filing the papers, etc. is not that hard. Harder if time constraint, but otherwise can just do it yourself
		- Some maintence overhead though
- CFI insurance as well
	- Look at SAFE and NAFI for these
		- One or both have insurance for flight insructors
		- And attoerny then can help with my particular situation and insurance
	- AOPA might have insurance
- Do you know if there's a way to get an estimate on how many hours I could expect each a particular type of plane to fly?
	- Flight school should know
- Are there policy documents I can reference from the club about ownership? 
	- For instance, I would like to use the DA40 (if I go that route) for long trips back to the midwest occasionally. 
	- How does cost-per-hour work as the owner?
	- What about non-flying day rates?
- Could I teach using the plane if a student was not part of the club?
- Any advice on who to work with for setting up company and that part of the equation?
- Any advice on where to find used planes?
- Any other questions to be asking?
	- Familiarize self with economics
	- Might want to look at other clubs, especially depends on which club you're with
		- Consider that club has different incentive than you (e.g. they don't mind if the plane is down)
		- May want to understand big things like do you need to replace TBO with maintence
		- Consider that you probably don't want the nicest plane on the line, want members to take care of it
		- Consider what other planes are in the fleet (shouldn't have the only one on the line)
		- Fees and things with the flight school
			- They'll charge renters the hourly rate. They manage maintence and insurance, then pass it all on to you
				- If you do it right, you'll just get a check
				- They'll take some percent of the revenue, so need to make sure to know the FBOs
- Todo
	- Look into insurance and tie downs
	- Variable costs
- Advice
	- Look into model for each type of aircraft
		- Whats fixed cost, what's variable cost, and how much would it need to fly
		- 172 was like 20-30 hours a month to break even
			- May generate profit then beyond that
		- Owning the plane was the right way to learn, although make sure you're learning about maintence and attending seminars
			- Useful to learn and watch how they fix things
	- Looking for 172 for about 4 months, and 182 in a couple months (in 2017)
	- Supply chain now for engines is a mess, and causing a big mess (6-8 months for an engine), so probably avoid one that is going to be overhauled immediently
	- WVFC does an ownership
	- San Carlos has 1-2 on aircraft ownership and several on maintence
	- Mike Bush does a few on how to make sure it's in good shape, "Savvy Aviation" youtube channel
