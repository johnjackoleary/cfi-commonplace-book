Questions for Steve:
* Any practical advice for me at this stage? How to approach commercial vs. IFR, etc?
    * Instrument, then commercial, then initial instructor rating (donâ€™t worry about Instrument or ME on those)
* Should I be thinking about trying to find students this early? Or will the club be a big help for that?
    * Likely do flight instructor with WVFC
        * Most schools screw over instructors
    * Just focus on ratings for now
