Overall:
- I consistently jumped to general answers to his questions, when almost always he wanted to see how I would handle a specific instance.
	- For instance, he asked if Porterville could be an alternate if we were flying to Bakersfield. I started to talk about standard alternate minimums and when you need an alternate when he wanted to see that I observed the "Alternate NA" on the Porterville plate.
- I went into the review thinking of it as an extension of the knowledge/written test, but it would have been better to think of it as an extension of the flight test.
	- For instance, when he asked about a hold at ALTAM and what entry I would use, I started to draw it out, subtract 70 degrees, etc. He interrupted me to say "you would have already passed the point trying to do all that math on paper".
	- Later, when talking about lost comms, he kept asking "what would ATC see you doing on radar". I tried to do the lost comms portion by memory, but in real life, I would have pulled out the lost comms reg or flow diagram. This would have helped my answer a lot, and it's what I actually would have done on a flight.
- I wish I had done the West Valley IFR quiz a couple of days before the exam, to brush up on some practical questions he might ask. The mock checkride was good for the flight portion, but the oral portion was different enough that the broad quiz would have helped.
- In short, the oral is not an "open book test" so much as it's a "simulation of things that might occur in flight". So could I pull out the AIM to review a weather briefing question? Sure, since that would happen on the ground. And for lost comms, a flow diagram would be very appropriate in flight, so it would also be fine. But diagramming a hold is unlikely to be reasonable unless you say something like "let me draw what I'd be seeing on the heading indicator".

Oral:
- I had printed out copies one all logs and endorsements. That seemed to make the process process quick.
- Question on reporting points: I showed my IFR kneeboard list, and Scott was fine with that. No further questions were asked.
- Question on how VOR, localizer, and GPS (+WAAS)
	- I had no idea for VORs, and he wasn't pleased with my rough overview.
	- I did well on the other two though, and that seemed to be sufficient for him.
- Much of the time was spent on the flight he asked me to plan.
	- From PAO to Porterville (PTV)
	- I planned along victor airways, which was a good idea
	- For fuel planning, make sure to include every step. 
		- Scott talks about this being a common failure point on his website
		- My fuel planning included:
			- Run up, Taxi, T/O
			- Climb
			- En Route
			- Approach
			- Missed
			- 3 Turns in Hold
			- En Route Alt
			- Alt Approach 
			- IFR Reserve
	- Although I didn't need an alternate for the weather, he asked I plan for one as though I did
	- We talked a lot about what allows an alternate to be used, and I jumped into standard alternate minimums. Scott wanted to hear things like checking the plates to see if it says "NA", such as in Porterville.
	- The weather on my checkride was very light and good. This was great for the flight portion but meant he grilled me on minor things for the TAFs and METARs. I should have pre-flighted such that I knew every symbol on those two (e.g. "$" and "A02")
	- I grabbed screenshots of portions of the standard briefing that I thought were noteworthy, and mentioned we could use those for discussion instead of going through every NOTAM. He liked this, and it also avoided NOTAM questions beyond the subset I picked out.
	- He asked if the "$" symbol in the SJC METAR meant we couldn't fly that day. I said it was a red flag, but I would use the corroborating evidence from airports around SJC to build confidence that it was safe to fly still. He seemed ok with that answer but didn't like that I didn't know what the symbol meant.
		- I got the impression from our debrief that he always asks something like "can we do this flight" at some part of the briefing. So when doing your standard briefing, try to identify what could be a problem, and have an answer for it.
	- He asked how often TAFs are updated. I got the impression he always asks that.


Flight:
- My flight portion was the same as other writeups, so I won't go into much more detail.
- I started with a passenger brief and talked about sterile cockpit around the airports. I mentioned since we'd be in that environment all day, I may not be able to answer questions in realtime, but would be happy to on the ground. This didn't matter though, as he asked almost no questions during the flight.
- I use ForeFlight quite extensively and did have my iPad overheat at one point. I used my phone as a backup, which was ok, but I had also printed the charts for my approaches in case. Fortunately, my overheat was on the ground before the ODP and unusual attitudes, so the iPad had time to cool off. Either way, I was glad to be prepared for this sort of thing.
- I also use ForeFlight checklists, and found out later Scott thought I wasn't using any checklists. I should have mentioned at the start that I'd be using my iPad for checklists â€” apparently, he was watching extra carefully that I didn't miss steps because he didn't see me referencing anything.
- One unexpected thing happened, in our hold at OYOSO ATC asked me to turn in early.
	- I panicked, declined, and asked to finish the hold (what even happens if you don't finish the hold as far as the ACS?). In retrospect, I should have complied with ATC and talked it over with Scott later. He probably would have said not to worry about it. 
	- Still, Scott seemed ok with my push back on ATC since he didn't like them making us turn in without a reason (later we found out it was traffic they wanted to investigate, but still).
- I also got asked by PAO tower on the way home to head to the field via VPKGO. I'd never heard of that point, so said "unfamiliar" and asked for vectors. Scott gave me a hard time in our debrief since it's a common point (most of my training before IFR was at SQL), but he generally thought it was fine. In retrospect, pretending to know and not complying could have been a failure on the checkride, but at the time I felt a lot of pressure to fake it.
