AOPA Legal Services Plan John O'Leary Case: 00059992
Talking to Michael Dworkin

## Questions for 30 Minute Discussion (Ordered by Priority)
* My wife has access to EAP financial advisor, will a non-aviation individual have the right knowledge for most tax questions? Or is aviation something you sort of need a specialty?
* Taxes
	* How do tax deductions work for me as I'm training to be a CFI? How should I think about business expenses more generally?
		*  Deduct cost of health insurance from my year-end taxes?
		*  Are my lessons deductible? Coursework? 
		* Rent other planes from the club, eg for current practice or new ratings?
		* Lunches with clients? Potential clients?
		* Part of my career is bringing in students with my blog posts. If those blog posts require me to spend money, is that deductible?
			* For instance, I want to write a blog post about transitioning to helicopters, since that pipeline is a major part of my business model
		* Could I throw a big lunch with demo flights to attract students deduct that
	* Does the order I do things in matter?
		* E.g. Commercial, then CFI, then by plane?
	* Any other records I should be tracking through this transition?
	* What about deducting from my Apple income from the beginning of the year?
	* If I purchase an aircraft, and use it to both teach and for personal, how does that work with writing off?
		* What about ongoing maintenance? 
	* What else should I be doing now to prepare for next tax season?
* Insurance
	* What insurance should I get for myself?
	* Is an LLC worth it?
	* If I buy an airplane, what insurance should I look at?
	* If I buy a primary category aircraft, does that change anything?
* Should my wife be doing anything differnet with her taxes since I'm not making income at the moment?
* Any other things I should be thinking about as a soon to be full time CFI?
