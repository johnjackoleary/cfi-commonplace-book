Hi John,

We're looking forward to your CFI training beginning  Sept 26th, 9am, at 1620 Henry Ave, South Saint Paul, Blue Hangar.    Bring a US Passport or Birth certificate.

Your examiner is DPE Barb Mack and your check ride has been scheduled for 0900,  at KANE. 


Your CFI cost structure can be found at:

https://www.airtreknorth.com/accelerated-cfi.html  or pay as you go.  You’ll need to decide prior to Feb 26.


Your study materials can be found at:

https://www.airtreknorth.com/cfi-initial-docs.html

~~Pls make sure you have paper copies of all items on the web page, or downloaded to a device you have access to without an internet connection.~~


If you need a hotel, the Microtel and Holiday Inn Express in Inver Grove Heights or Envision Hotel in South Saint Paul.  All are about 1.5 miles from the airport.



To study for the FOI and FIA writtens (FIA should be darn close to your commercial written), I would suggest using Sheppard Air.  They should be completed prior to starting your training.
 
Once done with your FOI and FIA writtens, we can start.  Below is the info you will need for your CFI training and check ride.  

You can fly in a a Cessna 172, Piper Archer or Piper Warrior.   I’d suggest whichever you are most familiar with.  Let me know which in the next day or two please so we can schedule your plane.  Currently, we have a cessna 172N scheduled for you.  

 
Here is the package you should put together prior to arrival.  They can be electronic versions or paper.

~~FAA Flying Handbook~~

All of the above are available online for free if you don't want to buy the
books.  You can use electronic copies if you want but they need to be
available to you during your check ride.~~

Paper copies of
Twin Cities Sectional


Also, Print off
