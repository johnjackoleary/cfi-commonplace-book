# Plan Overview
Should try all checklists by end and feel comfortable with planes handling. Should probably do this with a CFI (maybe this becomes my lesson plan?)

* Prep: Estimate performance values and note any unusual checklist items 
* Day 1: Standard operations
	* Confirm performance against POH estimates and record things like pitch during climbs
	* confirm all values of GAIT
	* Feel out handling for departure, en route, and arrival 
	* Stalls practice to practice slow flight, especially to prep base to final and landing flare 
	* Pattern practice at altitude then for real 
* Day 2: Emergencies and abnormal
	* Short field and soft field 
	* Engine out
	* All other checklists
* Day 3: Manuevers and handling


# Getting Familiar on Ground
Things like trying out nav system and practicing flows

## GAIT
| Altitude  | Mixture |     | 
| --------- | ------- | --- |
| 3000' MSL |         |     |
| 5000' MSL |         |     |
| 7000' MSL |         |     |
| 9000' MSL |         |     |
