Hey Lou,

I combined Cale and I's notes from our checkrides. The other writeups are super helpful, so this is just bonus content.

Oral:
- Asked if you could fly with a malfunctioning fuel gauge even after visually confirming full fuel in both tanks. The answer is no.
- Will ask you to interpolate/project off a performance chart due to extreme heat. The best answer is that you wouldn’t fly because the performance numbers aren’t in the book. You aren’t a test pilot.
- Usually asks you to decode a TAF/metar. Will ask how often they are issued. (Although he skipped these for me explicitly stating we did a short weather portion because he did my instrument rating.)
- Asked about how I'd get back to KPAO without a radio (basically the question on using and interpreting light guns)
- Asked how a constant speed prop worked, and what happens if it loses oil pressure.
- Asked about hazardous attitudes. I listed like three, explained what an antidote was, and gave and example + antidote for anti-authority. We moved on without going through all of them.
- He asked about other factors that going into a safe flight. I talked about PAVE and gave each letter's meaning, then we talked about pilot with IMSAFE and personal minimums. Pretty consistently it seemed he was ok to move quickly through things if I seemed to know them already and listed a few examples. (E.g. for IMSAFE I just said, "for example, am I emotionally fit to fly, on any impactful medications, or things like that")
- Discussed each type of airspace on a flight from Van Nuys (KVNY) to French Valley (F70). Basically said starting from surface directly up to 5500', what are airspaces and requirements, then over at 5500', then directly down. Did same thing at 10500' and 3500'. I missed a Golf airspace for the portion near French Valley were I pass within like 10' of the ground. Bob Hope (KBUR) class C has a weird line with the Bravo. I used ForeFlight's easier-to-read airspace lines to confirm I was reading it correctly (and got no reaction from Scott).
- Discussed pressurization and how it works
- Discussed supplemental oxygen systems systems. I totally missed on the different types of oxygen delivery. (Not just mask v. cannula, but continuous flow, pressure demand, etc)
- Questions about LAHSO. If you need to know the landing distance availabe, you can always ask the tower. I thought that would mean poor planning, but in debrief he said that's a good way to do it.


Practical:
- I called out each checklist after I used it. He didn't say anything, but I heard from many others he would have if I hadn't. I wish I'd practiced this a bit more in the weeks leading up since it's sort of a mindset of "The <blank> checklist is now complete".
- After my runup, ground cleared me to Y1 and contact tower. I switched to tower while taxing and said I was holding short of Y1. In the debrief, Scott chewed me out because I said I was somewhere when I wasn't, and I switched to tower before reaching Y1.
- Make sure to not have too long of legs on your XC. I had my first few waypoints as VPBDX, VPCOY, VPMIN, Meadowlark, KTCY, then on with legs of length ~40nm. He seemed ok with it, I think because I went VOR to VOR. (Leg lengths of ~80nm are a definite no-go.) However, he did not like that some of my waypoints were VOR radial intersections. They NEED to be usable for pilotage and dead reckoning.
- Because I had unusable waypoints after KTCY, I needed to update them at lunch. I used https://e6bx.com/e6b/ for calculations and found it very efficient.
- You have to be within 3 minutes at your waypoints, but I found I could vary my climb rate for each of the step-climbs between VPBDX (1000'), VPCOY (2500'), and VPMIN (5'500). For instance, I was getting ahead of schedule so I switched from cruise climb to Vy. Managed to hit my first three points within about a minute, and got to VPMIN almost exactly on time. Scott stopped the navlog portion at that point.
- Diversion was weirdly stated. He said "there's a medical emergency and I need to get to Salinas". My first thought was to go to a nearer airport for an emergency, but realized that he was just setting up for a diversion in an odd way. I turned to Salinas, used ForeFlight two-finger pinch thing to get distance, time, fuel, and heading. Then I bugged up the Salinas heading and fine tuned my direction.
- Did lazy eights, but not chandelles. He gave me a starting heading which seemed to align with mount diabolo.
- Most air work was at 5500'.
- Didn't do steep spiral descents, but did a simulated fire. I banked left and right to maintain 30-45 degrees, not a consistent spiral, and he was VERY annoyed in the debrief. Said I should have kept to a single direction so the flames aren't painting across the windshield at each turn.
- Eights on pylons was fine, although I couldn't describe my pylons well. This ended up being good because I changed pylons when i realized they were too close... Honestly a dangerous move with Scott, but he didn't seem to realize. He did make me to them around two full laps though.
- I got the winds from Tracy before doing eights on pylons, which is probably good because I need to know. However, we had calm winds, and now scott KNEW that I should be at a constant altitude. If I could do this different, I would have looked up surface winds in ForeFlight at Tracy before we left, and not told scott what they were.
- Gave me an emergency approach at LVK, not power off 180, but basically. Called it an emergency maneuver test, but I think it was so I could get a practice round in without the engine. Had me go around before landing.
- For the short approach and power-off, he gave me the threshold at first. I asked if we could move it back, and he said there's no rule saying he can't so he would. We used the first strip to the second strip IIRC, and it was MUCH easier to have an aiming point actually on the runway.
- I used a nose high, full flap side slip at the end of the power off 180, which worked super well (I was holding 60 kts in the C172, and his comment after was I could have gotten a bit slower to really steepen the descent). Scott was very pleased with that technique.
