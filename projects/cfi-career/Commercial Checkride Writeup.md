- Changed climb rate to hit checkpoints on cross country departurE
- Only did lazy eights, not chandelles
- moset airwork was at 5500'
- Used VOR instersects for nav points, and apparently not allowed. Had to change and update plan
- Gave me an emergency approach at lvk, not power off 180 but basically. Called it an emergency maneuver test, but I think it was so I could bacisally get a practice round in
