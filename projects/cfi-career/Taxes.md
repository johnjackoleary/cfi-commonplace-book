## Question for AOPA Tax Consultant
- Call on [[2022-02-10]]
	- Questions
		- How do tax deductitions work for me as I'm training to be a CFI? Is my lessons deductible? Coursework? Does the order I do things in matter?
		- Any other records I should be tracking through this transition?
	- Turns out this is more like a 30 minutes free with panel attorney type question, so need to prep that instead
