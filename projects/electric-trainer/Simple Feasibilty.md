#### Could it generate enough power with solar panels on wings?
Power required: 60 kW **at least**
Weight of solar panels for that power: 60000W * (1 sq ft / 17 w) * (3 lb / sq ft) = 10,500 lbs of solar panels
	Empty weight of C172 is 1,680 lbs, so not even a 10th available

- average solar panel produces from 170 to 350 watts every hour
- ~3 pounds per square foot
- 6 kW system with 20 average-sized panels, your system will likely measure approximately 27 feet wide by 13 feet long – 352 square feet in all
	- 17 watts / sq foot
- C172 has 174 sq. ft of wing area
	- could generate 17 * 174 = 3kW
- Most seem

So no, unlikely to be able to charge with solar without major innovation

#### Could it run off battery?
Weight to capacity: 30.7 kg/kWh
Capacity to range:

- Using hydrogen-electic instead of batteries



One of the most closely-watched hybrid aircraft experiments of recent years was [the E-Fan X](https://www.airbus.com/innovation/future-technology/electric-flight/e-fan-x.html), a joint project between Airbus, Siemens and Rolls-Royce. The concept for the plane featured a 100-seat BAE 146 aircraft that was to be modified so that one of its four engines would be powered by a 2 megawatt motor – that’s enough juice to power roughly 2,000 homes. The plan was to perform a [test flight with the aircraft this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jLrnvrK760)but the project was suddenly [canned in April](https://www.airbus.com/innovation/future-technology/electric-flight/e-fan-x.html).

#### Other Thoughts
- Could make this a cultural movement
- Could use this to drive energy into aviation generally
- Chance for government funding?
- Could do a eVTOL school, making the Bay Area a hub is a pretty natural choice with LA, San Diego, and the busy bay area
