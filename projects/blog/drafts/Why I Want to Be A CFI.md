Intro: Similar to planned before, with ending like ‚Äúso I‚Äôd like to share two stories from that introspection‚Äù

  

Teaching a teenager to sail is tricky business. 

  

  

What I love about teaching is helping someone build an understanding of the world that they can apply to new situations. I‚Äôve enjoyed several opportunities through my career to do this, 

  

  

It feels exactly like I imagine flying would. It feels just like in my dreams as a kid growing up, when I would flap my wings and take to the sky.

  

‚Äî‚Äî

  

  

  

‚ÄúWhich road should I take?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat, friend, depends on you.‚Äù

  

-   Intro

-   Most blog posts here will cover either learning, teaching, or flying. And they‚Äôll be a mix of conversational and technical.
-   Today though, I want to talk about talk about the most frequent response I‚Äôve heard since telling my friends/family/coworkers that I was leaving Apple to become a flight instructor: ‚ÄúGood for you for following your passion.‚Äù
-   Not covered in this post (although said almost as often): ‚ÄúWhat does your wife think about this?‚Äù üòÖ
-   When I hear the statement, I think people mean ‚Äúgood for you for turning a hobby into a career.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs missing the mark a bit though.
-   Instead, following your passion means building your career around your individuality. 

-   Said another way, it‚Äôs allowing those favorite parts of who you are define your path.

-   How to build a career is better for another blogger ‚Äî although stay tuned on mine if you want to see how it goes for me.
-   But I can tell you a bit about individuality.
-   Individuality is those aspects of yourself that are different from others. It can be skills, knowledge, preferences, experiences. All things internal; all things that are neither good or bad. They‚Äôre just what make you, you.
-   Finding your passion starts with finding your individuality.
-   Following your passion then is just figuring out how to apply that individuality to your career.

-   Finding your individuality.

-   Lots of things make you, you. So let‚Äôs focus just on the favorite things.
-   There‚Äôs also many dimensions to you, and not all of them apply to your career. So let‚Äôs target a few key areas.
-   What Color Is Your Parachute? did a good job setting these categories:

-   List all seven

-   From there, finding your favorite aspects of yourself requires deep introspection.

-   The book does this through various worksheets.
-   They are hard, and require soul searching.

-   Finally, the book asks you to prioritize. What aspects of yourself are most important at this point in life? 

-   Perhaps caring for a family is most important, and a career change would be too risky. I 

-   Following your passion.

-   It‚Äôs impractical to look for a career direction that matches all aspects of your individuality. But with a prioritized list, you can start to dig for jobs and companies that hit the most important elements.
-   For me, the most important elements were teaching and flying. Pretty straight forward career choice, in the end.
-   For others it may be more complicated. And it may take several steps to get into that career path.

  

  

  

  

  

‚Äî‚Äî

  

  

Flight instructors I‚Äôve met are good storytellers. Not only are they presented with interesting situations, they seem to recognize how a story will connect with the listener.

  

  

The first time a sailboat capsizes is arduous for anyone ‚Äî especially a teenager.

  

  

  

  

-   Intro

-   In the time since telling my friends/family/coworkers that I was leaving Apple to become a flight instructor, one phrase has come up more than any other: ‚ÄúGood for you for following your passion.‚Äù

-   It interesting to hear, because people mean finding a way to make a living flying. 
-   (The blog is called CFI Jack, for goodness sake!) 
-   But actually, I‚Äôm following my passion of teaching.

-   A close second: ‚ÄúWhat does your wife think about this?‚Äù üòÖ
-   So, I wanted to use this first blog post to talk about the process of deciding to become a CFI.
-   Most posts will be about learning, teaching, or flying. But this post is about why those topics.
-   So let‚Äôs start at the top: how did you decide on this path?
-   And to future students, I hope you see how excited I am to be your flight instructor.

-   Process of getting to this decision required a lot of introspection

-   Followed WCIYP
-   Lots of stories needed to be written for that
-   I learned many things about myself, but I learned mostly that I wanted to teach, not just teach a subject, but build lesson plans
-   I wanted to share two stories I wrote as part of that introspection. I hope they help frame the blog (teaching and flying), and help future students see why I‚Äôm so excited to work with you.
-   The first story is one of several I wrote for self reflection. I cleaned it up a bit, but you can 
-   First, finding your passion. Everyone is an individual, and so what worked for me may not work for you. (We‚Äôll come back to that later.) But I hope hearing the process and seeing a result may help kick off the most important element: deep personal introspection.
-   I approached this following the Flower Exercise in What Color Is Your Parachute?. The Flower Exercise frames itself as a different way to approach career decisions: instead of looking at the job market and what openings there are, start by looking at yourself. It divides you into seven ‚Äòpetals‚Äô, each relating to a different aspect of a potential future job.
-   Throughout the exercises, you‚Äôre asked to make priority calls. This is hard, and the author has some tools for facilitating. But it‚Äôs important because no career perfectly fits what you want, and so you need to decide what is going to matter to you at this stage in your life. Perhaps you‚Äôre starting a family, and salary is the biggest consideration. Or maybe you‚Äôre at a stage where you‚Äôre looking to your long term impact, and career decisions.
-   You‚Äôre asked to prioritize within each petal as well. Not just listing your favorite transferable skills, but ordering them by preference. To figure out what skills to include, and the priority order, the book gives several prompts of essays to write. Yes, they‚Äôre a pain. But the reflection is where you learn about yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs how you start to see the shape of your passion.
-   Following your passion is really about picking priorities. And I don‚Äôt mean prioritizing your hobbies over your career, I mean thoughtfully choosing what you need to prioritize for the stage of life you‚Äôre at, and then leaning into it. For some people that‚Äôll mean staying in a good job and a good company trying to get that promotion. For other people it‚Äôll mean prioritizing
-   Ok, so what about me? I‚Äôm prioritizing honing my craft at this stage of career. My focus is on using transferable skills I enjoy and knowledge I possess. The author notes that you can skip the other petals if they aren‚Äôt a priority, but I wanted to get the complete picture.
-   I tried to keep a neutral perspective doing the exercises, but when I finished them and looked at the whole thing, flight instructor popped out right away. Not only does it use the top priority skills and knowledge, it hits a number of my lower priority petals as well!
-   Of course, people grow throughout their life, and I expect my flower to change in the coming years. But as a starting point for the next chapter, I‚Äôm incredibly excited to be able to follow my passion: teaching.

-   Two stories, both true

-   Teaching kid to sail at Boy Scout camp

-   Thesis: What I love about teaching is the individual. Regardless of the class size or topic, learning is an individual experience, and that makes my job to connect that specific person to the content in a way they understand it.

-   Teaching is about giving the student the right basis and framework for handling situations beyond what we could have planned for

-   I‚Äôm not going to bore you with stories of various individuals and how they learn, but I did want to highlight one example.
-   I was a camp counselor for a number of years, helping teenagers learn various skills while sleeping in a tent every night.
-   It wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd helped others learn new skills, but it was pivotal in showing me the joy of watching someone understand a concept for the first time, and be able to apply it.
-   It was also where I really learned what it meant to watch the weather every day, and change lesson plans to suit it. A skill I plan to use regularly in my new job.
-   Of course, there‚Äôs hardships to learning. 
-   Every student is different and every lesson translates differently. 
-   This interface between idea and individual is what originally got me into tech: how do you present data and information in a way that conveys the idea correctly and completely? 
-   Actually chasing that question gave me many good years in tech, trying to see how individuals interact with technology. 
-   But under the hood, it‚Äôs always about how individuals interact with ideas.
-   I was a camp counselor for several summers at Tomahawk Scout Camp.
-   I earned my Eagle Scout rank in the Boy Scouts.
-   I grew up sailing and frequently taught young scouts how to sail.
-   There‚Äôs lots of ways to teach different types of people and different topics ‚Äî will cover those things later.
-   At the end of the day, the goal is to help an individual apply a skill in a situation they‚Äôve never encountered before
-   Running procedures and practicing for the known is key, but knowing the systems and how to apply them when new situations arise is critical
-   I had one student in my class, brand new to sailing and learning with several friends who had all sailed before. This can be dicey, as he could skate through the class by just teaming up with them for each lesson and faking it. So I changed up the curriculum slightly to make the lessons more ‚Äòlearn as a group, demonstrate as an individual‚Äô
-   The first time you capsize a sailboat can be stressful. The boat starts to tip until finally it fully lays on it‚Äôs side.
-   My students knew the procedure with two people on board ‚Äî one swims to the mast and keeps the boat from ‚Äòturtling‚Äô, and one swims to the hull to start pulling the boat upright.
-   We practice these in shallow water first to learn the basics, but a student‚Äôs first unexpected capsize is different. Typically it happens with a big gust of wind, and it can happen fast.
-   I had one student, let‚Äôs call him Aaron, who was very nervous to capsize. He was worried about all the variables and what he would do if things didn‚Äôt go as planned.
-   And he‚Äôs right, things rarely go exactly as planned.
-   I walked him through the procedure, and asked him to bring some what if scenarios. As he asked them, I slowly moved the dialog from ‚Äúhere‚Äôs one way to handle that‚Äù to ‚Äúhow would you handle it? Why?‚Äù
-   Sure enough, he had built up a base of knowledge that allowed him to reason through the right response, even when the variables were different than we trained for.
-   And one day, late in the week, he did capsize.
-   I started to speed over in the safety boat to help out, and could hear him shouting things like ‚Äúunclet the main‚Äù and ‚Äúturn the boat into the wind‚Äù. We‚Äôd talked about 
-   Scared of what could go wrong, to learning how to apply what he learned to new situations.
-   That, to me, is the most rewarding part of teaching. It‚Äôs amazing to see a student complete a maneuver for the first time. But I most enjoy seeing a student apply their base of knowledge to tackle a situation we never trained for.

-   Solo flight practicing over Chippewa Flowage

-   Thesis: To me, at this point in life, flying is
-   Coincidentally, second story also in Wisconsin.
-   I was just about to take my exam for my private pilot‚Äôs license, and was out practicing maneuvers each morning.
-   I was working on California time then, which meant I could get about 3 hours of flying in if I got to the plane before sunrise.
-   Took the C152 out of Hayward, and headed to Chippewa Flowage.
-   It was late September, so mornings were brisk. And the manure in Wisconsin, while rough on the nose, causes the most beautiful sunrises you‚Äôll ever see.
-   I took off as the sun was peaking up, and got to the water just as the colors peaked. Beautiful reds in the sky reflected off cool water. (Although some of you may have picked up a red sky usually means bad weather to come ‚Äî sure enough, it was m last flight for several days.)
-   I started practicing slow flight, where you bring the plane to an airspeed just a bit faster than the speed when it can no longer fly
-   This is an important maneuver, because it‚Äôs what you do as you land on a runway. With several thousand feet between me and the ground though, I could feel the edge of where the plan could fly.
-   It‚Äôs surreal to hang like that ‚Äî barely moving forward ‚Äî and to feel the plane so closely.
-   Slow flight is often described as mushy controls. And it is, since you have less airflow over the control surfaces and so the plane doesn‚Äôt respond as well.
-   But it‚Äôs also magical.
-   You balance the plane right at the edge of where it will start to fall (with plenty of practice recovering from this, called a stall ‚Äî safety first!)
-   And you can feel the airflow over the wings. Mushy, sure. But so balanced. (Find a better word!)
-   ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful day for flying!‚Äù

There‚Äôs lots of ways to learn (we‚Äôll talk about them in future blog posts), but sometimes 

  

‚Äî‚Äî

  

  

Following your passion is really about picking priorities. And I don‚Äôt mean prioritizing your hobbies over your career, I mean thoughtfully choosing what you need to prioritize for the stage of life you‚Äôre at, and then leaning into it. For some people that‚Äôll mean staying in a good job and a good company trying to get that promotion. For other people it‚Äôll mean prioritizing

  

‚Äî‚Äî

  

  

But this blog isn‚Äôt for them, and this first blog post is to set up how I realized I wanted to focus my next career steps (and this blog!) on two specific subjects: flying and teaching. (I suppose we‚Äôll also talk about certification, to hit on each word of Certified Flight Instructor ‚Äî but mostly the FI.)

  

I also went back and forth about writing this blog as a letter about myself vs. a letter to the reader. And this first post, dear reader, will be about me.

  

Despite the title, 

  

  

‚Äî‚Äî

  

  

  

In the time since telling my friends/family/coworkers that I was leaving Apple to become a flight instructor, one phrase has come up more than any other: ‚ÄúGood for you for following your passion.‚Äù

  

A close second: ‚ÄúWhat does your wife think about this?‚Äù üòÖ

  

(Fortunately good news there ‚Äî my wife is on board. The puppy seems excited too!)

  

So this first post is about following your passion. This post is not about turning a hobby into a career (although that‚Äôs sort of how it worked out for me.) It‚Äôs about reflecting on all aspects of you as a working professional, identifying those things you‚Äôd like to prioritize in a career, and confirming that nothing is dropped in the process. (Aka don‚Äôt quit your job without a budget.)

  

  

  

, and how what I  to friends/family/coworkers, . And to future students, I hope you see how excited I am to be your flight instructor.

  

First, finding your passion. Everyone is an individual, and so what worked for me may not work for you. (We‚Äôll come back to that later.) But I hope hearing the process and seeing a result may help kick off the most important element: deep personal introspection.

  

I approached this following the Flower Exercise in What Color Is Your Parachute?. The Flower Exercise frames itself as a different way to approach career decisions: instead of looking at the job market and what openings there are, start by looking at yourself. It divides you into seven ‚Äòpetals‚Äô, each relating to a different aspect of a potential future job.

  

Throughout the exercises, you‚Äôre asked to make priority calls. This is hard, and the author has some tools for facilitating. But it‚Äôs important because no career perfectly fits what you want, and so you need to decide what is going to matter to you at this stage in your life. Perhaps you‚Äôre starting a family, and salary is the biggest consideration. Or maybe you‚Äôre at a stage where you‚Äôre looking to your long term impact, and career decisions.

  

You‚Äôre asked to prioritize within each petal as well. Not just listing your favorite transferable skills, but ordering them by preference. To figure out what skills to include, and the priority order, the book gives several prompts of essays to write. Yes, they‚Äôre a pain. But the reflection is where you learn about yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs how you start to see the shape of your passion.

  

Ok, so what about me? I‚Äôm prioritizing honing my craft at this stage of career. My focus is on using transferable skills I enjoy and knowledge I possess. The author notes that you can skip the other petals if they aren‚Äôt a priority, but I wanted to get the complete picture.

  

Here‚Äôs how my flower turned out:

  

  

I tried to keep a neutral perspective doing the exercises, but when I finished them and looked at the whole thing, flight instructor popped out right away. Not only does it use the top priority skills and knowledge, it hits a number of my lower priority petals as well!

  

Of course, people grow throughout their life, and I expect my flower to change in the coming years. But as a starting point for the next chapter, I‚Äôm incredibly excited to be able to follow my passion: teaching.

In the week since I announced to my friends/family/coworkers that I was leaving Apple to become a flight instructor, one phrase has come up more than any other: ‚ÄúGood for you for following your passion‚Äù.

  

A close second: ‚ÄúWhat does your wife think about this?‚Äù üòÖ

  

Fortunately good news on both fronts. My wife is supportive, and she was part of the process that lead to my decision. So to my friends/family/coworkers, I hope this is an interesting dive into that process. And to future students, I hope you see how excited I am to be your flight instructor. (And to anyone reading this going ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt he talking about airplanes?‚Äù, I promise they‚Äôll be a large part of future blog posts.)

  

First, finding your passion. Everyone is an individual, and so what worked for me may not work for you. (We‚Äôll come back to that later.) But I hope hearing the process and seeing a result may help kick off the most important element: deep personal introspection.

‚Äî‚Äî

  

  

-   Let‚Äôs talk about passion.
-   I promise most blog posts will be about flying or teaching.
-   CFI as capital-I
-   Passion is an expression of your individuality.
-   What I enjoy about teaching is helping individuals understand ideas.

  

-   I want to talk about following your passion, but really what I want to talk about is the individual.

-   Following your passion is chasing the things that make you, you.
-   Teaching is about helping an individual connect with an idea and be able to apply it. 

-   Individuals are easy unique, and so each lesson is a bit different.

-   Intro

-   The most frequent response I‚Äôve heard to quitting my job to become a flight instructor is ‚Äúgood for you for following your passion‚Äù. 

-   It interesting to hear, because people mean finding a way to make a living flying. 
-   (The blog is called CFI Jack, for goodness sake!) 
-   But actually, I‚Äôm following my passion of teaching.

-   The second is ‚Äúwhat does your wife think?‚Äù

-   I think that‚Äôs a way of saying ‚Äúis the person who knows you best concerned with this choice.
-   (Fortunately not in my case.)

-   My passion is teaching

-   So now I‚Äôm off to follow my passion, instructing.
-   We used to say an EPM at Apple was a capital-E position: engineering. 

-   We are engineers first and bring that always into our work. 
-   So, I‚Äôm excited for a new role with my capital-I.

-   I was a camp counselor for a number of years, helping teenagers learn various skills while sleeping in a tent every night.
-   It wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd helped others learn new skills, but it was pivotal in showing me the joy of watching someone understand a concept for the first time, and be able to apply it.
-   It was also where I really learned what it meant to watch the weather every day, and change lesson plans to suit it. A skill I plan to use regularly in my new job.
-   Of course, there‚Äôs hardships to learning. 
-   Every student is different and every lesson translates differently. 

-   This interface between idea and individual is what originally got me into tech: how do you present data and information in a way that conveys the idea correctly and completely? 
-   Actually chasing that question gave me many good years in tech, trying to see how individuals interact with technology. 
-   But under the hood, it‚Äôs always about how individuals interact with ideas.

-   Following your passion

-   So everyone is different and my process may or may not help you identify your passion. 

-   And even if you do find it, chasing it may not be the right career decision for other reasons. 

-   I liked the philosophy form WCIYP, because it started from you as an individual, not the particulars of the job market. 

-   (Although do not worry, job market is part of the equation.)
-   The Flower Exercise is their approach to examining 7 aspects of who you are. 
-   I‚Äôll skip the details, since the book is worth a read. 
-   My flower came out like this.

-   The other aspect is prioritizing. 

-   Not all petals apply evenly at all points in life, and not all items on a petal can be hit.

The most frequent response I‚Äôve heard to quitting my job to become a flight instructor is ‚Äúgood for you for following your passion‚Äù. The second is ‚Äúwhat does your wife think?‚Äù

  

I think that‚Äôs a way of saying ‚Äúis the person who knows you best concerned with this choice. Fortunately not in my case.

  

What about the first phrase? It interesting to hear, because people mean finding a way to make a living flying. (The blog is called CFI Jack, for goodness sake!) But actually, I‚Äôm following my passion of teaching.

  

I was a camp counselor for a number of years, helping teenagers learn various skills while sleeping in a tent every night. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd helped others learn new skills, but it was pivotal in showing me the joy of watching someone understand a concept for the first time, and be able to apply it.

  

Of course, there‚Äôs hardships to learning. Every student is different and every lesson translates differently. This interface between idea and individual is what originally got me into tech: how do you present data and information in a way that conveys the idea correctly and completely? Actually chasing that question gave me many good years in tech, trying to see how individuals interact with technology. But under the hood, it‚Äôs always about how individuals interact with ideas.

  

So now I‚Äôm off to follow my passion, instructing.

  

We used to say an EPM at Apple was a capital-E position: engineering. We are engineers first and bring that always into our work. So, I‚Äôm excited for a new role with my capital-I.

  

  

So everyone is different and my process may or may not help you identify your passion. And even if you do find it, chasing it may not be the right career decision for other reasons. 

  

I liked the philosophy form WCIYP, because it started from you as an individual, not the particulars of the job market. (Although do not worry, job market is part of the equation.)

  

The Flower Exercise is their approach to examining 7 aspects of who you are. I‚Äôll skip the details, since the book is worth a read. My flower came out like this.

  

The other aspect is prioritizing. Not all petals apply evenly at all points in life, and not all items on a petal can be hit. So we prioritize. 

  

For me, the priority was impact, knowledge, and skills. Taking a obvious backseat is salary (although I keep my preferred level of responsibility!), although I‚Äôm lucky that most petals seem to line up well for a CFI. That‚Äôs why I was such an easy choice for me, after doing the reflection.

  

Also the flower changes over life. I worry about publishing mine at all for risk of getting boxed in.
