Outline:
* Background on sprints and agile development
* Idea behind Nested Sprints
	* Include image here
* Use in practice
	* Story point sizes
	* Velocity of progress
	* Story point limits per day and per week
	* Contrasting with main use cases for Agile
		* No need to be able to estimate when things will be done, however can sanity check from velocity vs. list of all work remaining
	* Inbox for unplanned tasks
* Tools for this
	* Obsidian
	* Trello
