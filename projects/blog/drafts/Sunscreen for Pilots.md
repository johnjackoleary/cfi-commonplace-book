	* Pilots are twice as likely to develop skin cancer as the general population, according to a 2015 study by the University of California. While windscreens absorb much of the UVB spectrum, UVA absorption varies widely by the design and manufacture of the windscreen.
	* I know very few pilots (myself included) who wear sunscreen in the cockpit—but it might not be a bad idea.

	* "For every additional 900 meters (2,952 feet) of altitude above sea level, there is a 15 percent increase in intensity of UV radiation. At 9,000 meters (29,527 feet), where most commercial aircraft fly, the UV level is approximately twice that of the ground," the analysis authors wrote.

	* "For you, even as a frequent flyer, if you’re applying broad spectrum sunscreen daily as you know you should, for the amount of time you’ll be potentially exposed to increased UVA on your flight, you probably accrue no significant increased risk for melanoma," said Dr. Schultz. "But if it’s a daylight flight and you have a window seat, if you’re still concerned, pull down the shade and have a nice trip."
