Hello!

My name is John O'Leary -- although everyone calls me Jack. Nice to meet you!

You may know me as Jules Altis -- this is my screen name for live streams or online community interactions (such as planning Microsoft Flight Sim fly-ins).

My (smart, beautiful, and patient) wife suggested a first blog post should set up the blog. She's probably correct, and so this first post is a bit meta.

This blog covers topics across learning, teaching, and flying. 

My goal is for each post to:
- Be self-contained, in that you don't need to read other posts to get the value. 
- Have a subtitle that concisely and correctly summarizes the topic, so you can decide if you'd like to read it.
- Include at least one meaningful application for everyday life. Not just having a takeaway, but some plausibly useful idea that you could turn around and apply.
- Connect to other ideas or domains where possible. I strongly believe in Charlie Munger's Latticework of Mental Models, and hope fitting ideas into a broader context will make the knowledge more useful.
- Iteratively improve over previous posts -- whether in writing, formatting, content, or something else. (To that end, please reach out through a comment below or a message from the "Contact" page if you have suggestions!)


For this post's plausibly useful idea: Learning, Teaching, and Flying is an example of the [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)):
> a writing principle that suggests that a trio of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers. The audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern.


Until next time!
Jack
