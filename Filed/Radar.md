# Key Takeaways
- Either primary (radio wave "bounces back" off aircraft) or secondary (using [[transponder]]s) radar
- Primary radar has several limitations which [[ADS-B]] has helped address
- Either Airport Surveillance Radar ([[ASR]]) and Air Route Surveillance Radar ([[ARSR]])

# Details
## Primary Radar
> [!quote] From [[Pilot-Controller Glossary]]
> A radar system in which a minute portion of a radio pulse transmitted from a site is reflected by an object and then received back at that site for processing and display at an air traffic control facility.

### Limitations
#todo :: add from AIM 4-5

## Secondary Radar/Radar Beacon ([[ATCRBS]])
> [!quote] From [[Pilot-Controller Glossary]]
> A radar system in which the object to be detected is fitted with cooperative equipment in the form of a radio receiver/transmitter ([[transponder]]). Radar pulses transmitted from the searching transmitter/receiver ([[interrogator]]) site are received in the cooperative equipment and used to trigger a distinctive transmission from the transponder. This reply transmission, rather than a reflected signal, is then received back at the transmitter/receiver site for processing and display at an air traffic control facility.

***Definition***    :: A system that uses electromagnetic waves to identify the range, altitude, direction, or speed of both moving and fixed objects such as aircraft, weather formations, and terrain.
***Additional Info:*** The term RADAR was coined in 1941 as an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging. The term has since entered the English language as a standard word, radar, losing the capitalization in the process.
