alias: deviation

***Definition***    :: Because of magnetic influences within an aircraft, such as electrical circuits, radio, lights, tools, engine, and magnetized metal parts, the compass needle is frequently deflected from its normal reading. This deflection is called deviation. The deviation is different for each aircraft, and it also may vary for different headings in the same aircraft.

> [!summary] From [[PHAK Ch8]]
> The magnets in a compass align with any magnetic field. Some causes for magnetic fields in aircraft include flowing electrical current, magnetized parts, and conflict with the Earthâ€™s magnetic field. These aircraft magnetic fields create a compass error called deviation.
