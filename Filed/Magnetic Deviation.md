***Definition***    :: Because of magnetic influences within an aircraft, such as electrical circuits, radio, lights, tools, engine, and magnetized metal parts, the compass needle is frequently deflected from its normal reading. This deflection is called deviation. The deviation is different for each aircraft, and it also may vary for different headings in the same aircraft.
