# Key Takeaways
- Night airport operations require a thorough understanding of lights and their meanings.
- Proper planning will help identify the airport while inbound, then use the runway and taxiways effectively.

> [!tip]
> The best images for these Jack could find are in the [[AOPA]] [runway safety slides](https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/aopa/runwaysafetyflashcard/index.php#/p/60), starting at roughly slide 60.

# Details
## Airport Lights

### Approach Lighting Systems ([[ALS]])
> [!quote] From [[AIM 2]]-1-1
> ALS provide the basic means to transition from instrument flight to visual flight for landing.

> [!tip] Examples can be found in the [[TPP]] and [[AIM 2]]
> See [TPP supplemental page 18](https://www.1800wxbrief.com/Website/aip/tpp/FRNTMATTER.pdf#page=18) in particular.

## Pilot-Controlled Lighting ([[PCL]])
- Pilot-controlled lighting and how to operate
- 15 minute duration
- Key mike intended number of times within 5 seconds

> [!tip]
> It is possible for a tower-controlled light system to be turned off, even with pilots inbound.
> 
> If you can't find a towered airport at night, you may need to ask for the lights to be turned on.

## Which Lights Are Available
This is good to brief as part of [[All Available Information Concerning That Flight]].

Consider questions like:
- Which side of the runway is the VASI?
- Is the windsock lighted?
- Are there any obstacles on final to be careful of?
