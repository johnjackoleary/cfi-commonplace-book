***Quote***  :: Plato understood that emotions could trump reason and that to succeed we have to use the reins of [[reason]] on the horse of [[emotion]]. That turns out to be remarkably close to what modern research has begun to show us, and it works both ways: The intellect without the emotions is like the jockey without the horse.
