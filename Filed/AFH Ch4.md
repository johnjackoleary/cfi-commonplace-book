***Key Quotes***:
- How the pilot coordinates the throttle and elevator to achieve and maintain desired altitude and airspeed targets as well as avoid energy "crises" is at the core of energy management and is elaborated in the rest of the chapter.
- The throttle then is the total energy controller.... the elevator is the energy distribution controller
- pilots should be equipped with the ability to  identify, assess, and mitigate two major risks associated with mismanagement of energy: 1) unwanted deviations from the desired energy state; and 2) unintentional, irreversible deceleration and/or sink rate
