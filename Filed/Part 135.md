These are the FAA's rules for "non-scheduled" and "charter" operations. Private jets also fly under Part 135.

To fly under Part 135:
- The plane must have < 30 seats, with payload < 7500 pounds, and make 5 or fewer round trips per week between any two destinations.
- The operator must have a "Commercial Operating Certificate"
- In some cases, a pilot may fly for a Part 135 with only a Commercial Pilot License
	- But there are additional requirement for hours of experience, and ratings
- However, if the aircraft has 10+ seats, or is a turbojet, or is multiengine, an Air Transport Pilot rating is required.  See FAR 135.243.
