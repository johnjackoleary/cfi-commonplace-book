***Meaning*** :: <u>I</u>ndicated <u>A</u>ir<u>s</u>peed
***Definition***    :: Shown on the dial of the instrument [[airspeed]] indicator on an aircraft. Indicated airspeed (IAS) is the airspeed indicator reading uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. 
***Additional Details***: Indicated airspeed means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors. Calibrated airspeed ([[CAS]]) is IAS corrected for instrument errors, position error (due to incorrect pressure at the static port) and installation errors.
