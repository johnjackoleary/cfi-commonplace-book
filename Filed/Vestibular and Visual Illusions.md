## Sensing Our Orientation and Movement
Our body relies on three key systems to track our orientation and movement in space. They are: 
1. the inner ear sensors ([[Vestibular System]])
2. body/nerves ([[Somatosensory System]]), and
3. eyes ([[Visual System]])

In [[VMC]], our eyes are the major orientation source, and will win out if other senses provide conflicting information.

In [[IMC]], however, visual references are unavailable and we become susceptible to many types of illusions. 

## Preventing Spatial Disorientation
If we are unsure of our orientation, we are suffering from [[spatial disorientation]]. This is most likely to occur when we loose visual reference to the horizon.

From [[PHAK Ch17]]:
> Prevention is usually the best remedy for spatial disorientation. 
> - Unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, **flight should be avoided in reduced visibility** or at night when the horizon is not visible.
> - A pilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions through **training and awareness** and **learning to rely totally on flight instruments**.

As my grandpa used to say:  *Trust your instruments!*

## Illusions To Watch Out For
### Vestibular Illusions

**Illusions of Long or Slowly Developing Turns:** 
- [[The Leans]]: `= [[The Leans]].definition`
- [[Graveyard Spiral]]: `= [[Graveyard Spiral]].definition`

These result in incorrect banking by the pilot.

**From Some Accelerations Feeling the Same as Climbs/Descents:**
- [[Somatogravic Illusion]]: `= [[Somatogravic Illusion]].definition`
- [[Inversion Illusion]]: `= [[Inversion Illusion]].definition`
- [[Elevator Illusion]]: `= [[Elevator Illusion]].definition`

These result in incorrect pitching by the pilot.

**Dealers Choice of Problems:**
- [[Coriolis Illusion]]: `= [[Coriolis Illusion]].definition`

Depending on the head motion, this could feel like a number of different maneuvers.

### Visual Illusions
Visual illusions are especially hazardous because pilots rely on their eyes for correct information.

- [[False Horizon]]: `= [[False Horizon]].definition`
- [[Autokinesis|Autokinesis (aka UFO Syndrome)]]: `= [[Autokinesis]].definition`

#todo :: Add upslope/downslope runway, wide/narrow runway, and [[Empty Field Myopia]]
