# Key Takeaways
- A safety pilot is required when "under the hood"^[[[FAR 91.109 Flight Instruction, Sim Instrument, Tests|FAR 91.109]]]
- Safety pilot requirements change slightly if that person will be acting as PIC (and logging PIC time) or if they will not
- Seeing how others fly is an excellent way to improve as a pilot

# Details
## Requirements for All Safety Pilots
1. Be at least a private pilot
2. Hold category and class ratings for the aircraft^[E.g. [[ASEL]]]
3. Have a current medical^[[[BasicMed]] works equally as of 2022]
4. Occupy the other control seat

### Requirements to Act as PIC
In order to act as PIC, the safety pilot must meet the qualifications to be PIC. In addition to the items above, this includes things like:
- Required endorsements
- Currency

If these qualifications are not met, or if the person would prefer not to act as PIC, they can still be a safety pilot.

## Acting or Not Acting as PIC
While only one pilot may be ***serving as PIC***, both pilots may be ***logging PIC time***.

> [!quote] From [[Hicks 1993]]
> The two pilots may, prior to initiating the flight, agree that the safety pilot will be the PIC responsible for the operation and safety of the aircraft during the flight.
> 
>  If this is done, then the safety pilot may log all the flight time as PIC time in accordance with [[FAR 1.1|FAR 1.1]] and the pilot under the hood may log, concurrently, all of the flight time during which he is the sole manipulator of the controls as PIC time in accordance with [[FAR 61.51 Pilot Logbooks|FAR 61.51]](c)(2)(i).

If a safety pilot cannot or does not want to act as PIC, they may instead log [[SIC]] time, if they'd like. A common example is if the safety pilot is not endorsed for a HP plane.^[Although, it may not be wise to have a safety pilot who is not familiar with the plane.]

> [!Warning] 
> Acting as PIC is a serious responsibility. What if the aircraft is involved in an accident or violates a regulation? Does a flying club policy or insurance restrict who can be PIC?


### Example Scenarios
> [!example]- My uncle has a private pilot license ([[ASEL]]). He has a current medical, but hasn't flown in 15 years. Can he be a safety pilot in a Cessna 172? Can he act as PIC?
> - Safety Pilot: Yes^[Although legal, it may not be wise to fly with someone so out of practice]
> - PIC: No, not current and no [[FAR 61.56 Flight Review|flight review]]

> [!example]- My friend has a [[PPL]] ASEL with [[HP]] and tailwheel. He is current for flying, but his medical recently expired. Safety Pilot for a Cessna 180? PIC?
> - Neither without a current medical

> [!example]- My roommate is [[CPL]] ASEL with HP endorsement. She is not a member of my flying club, but she is current and flies regularly. Safety Pilot for a Cessna 182? PIC?
> - Safety Pilot: Yes
> - PIC: Depends on club and insurance policies.

## Logging
The pilot "under the hood" is required to log the name of the safety pilot.^[[[FAR 61.51 Pilot Logbooks]]] [[AOPA]] suggests the safety pilot also log the name of the other pilot.

The safety pilot may not log cross-country time, since they are not required for the entire flight.

## Sample Conversation Before Departure
> [!quote]
> If you'd like to act as PIC, and therefore log PIC, you'll need to be qualified and current to fly this airplane today. Could you take me (a passenger) up flying today?
> 
> *If so:* You'll be acting as PIC for the parts of this flight I'm under the hood. That means you can log that time as PIC, although you're also responsible for keeping us safe and legal. Of course, I'll also be attentive to those things as well.
> 
> *If not:* We can still fly together, and I'll act as PIC. You'll be my eyes outside for see-and-avoid, although any additional help is greatly appreciated. You can log SIC time if you'd like.
