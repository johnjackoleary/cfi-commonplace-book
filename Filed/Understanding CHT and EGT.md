#### Key Quotes
* [[CHT]] measures heat energy wasted during the power stroke, when the cylinder is under maximum stress from high internal pressures and temperatures.
* [[EGT]] measures heat energy wasted during the exhaust stroke, when the cylinder is under relatively low stress.
* High CHTs generally indicate that the engine is under excessive stress for its own good.... By contrast, high EGTs do not indicate that the engine is under excessive stress.
