These are the FAA's "General Operating Rules" governing how flight operations must take place. Most rules that a Private Pilot learns (everything from cruising altitudes, to airspace restrictions, to right of way rules) are found in the subsections of this part.

By default, a flight operates under Part 91.  But Part 119 explains the situations in which a flight must operate under [[Part 121]] or [[Part 135]] instead.
