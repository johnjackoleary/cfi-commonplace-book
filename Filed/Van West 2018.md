#### Key Quotes
* An operable transponder is not a substitute for two-way communication between the pilot and ATC, nor for the estimated time of arrival filed in the pilot's flight plan on which the ATC relies to make other safety-based determinations. Therefore, we affirm our previous interpretations of ยง [[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms|91.185]](c)(3).
