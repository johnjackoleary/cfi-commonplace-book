A #lecture at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|Oshkosh]] 2025 by Michael Lents of [[UND]]. Related to [[Spin Lesson Plan]] and [[PPL2.3 Power-On Stalls and Spin Awareness|PPL2.3]].

1. Sometimes scenario-based is probably not good for spins, already intense enough without
2. Archers and cherokees are generally not certified for spins in utility 
3. From [[AC 61-67]]: In a Normal Category: "It must be impossible to obtain uncontrollable spins with any use of the flight or engine power controls either at the entry or during the spin"
4. [[Cessna 172]]SP G1000 is hard to get into the utility category because of weight of the avionics in the back
5. Need to teach spin procedure on the ground, because CFIs in the airplane either speed up talking or slow down recovery, neither of which really work
6. Keep it calm for teaching even if things getting exciting 
7. Remember: You're not finished until climbing 
8. Starting altitude of 6000’ recommended in case. It takes 25 turns to lose 6000’ (3 turns to lose 1500’, 6 turns to lose 2000’)
9. For Power-Off entry, may be easier to use ~1500 RPM.
10. Make sure stick not forward too long on recovery
11. To find rotation direction: Look off the nose. Ground moves to one shoulder. That’s the rudder you push.
12. If airspeed is increasing, you’re spiraling, not spinning, and you need to recover. Also if g-load increases.
13. If you’re light in the seat, you’ve recovered 
14. His spin lesson plan:
	1. Stall
	2. Falling Leaf
	3. Power-Off - 1-turn
		1. Build Up to Fully Developed
	4. Break From Stalls - Cross-Controlled Slip vs. Skid
	5. Power-On - 1-turn
	6. Build Up to Fully Developed
	7. Aerodynamics Demo?
