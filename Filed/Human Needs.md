![[Hierarchy of Needs.png]]*Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs* 

Until the needs are satisfied, one cannot focus on learning.

1. **Physiological**: Instructors should monitor the learners to make sure their basic physical needs are met (not hungry, dehydrated, tired, etc.)
2. **Security**: Instructor should be aware of the learner's fear of flying and ease them into it carefully.
3. **Belonging**: Instructor should welcome the learners into the field of aviation, be it a career or hobby for learners.
4. **Esteem**: Self-esteem can come from internal judgement but most people seek external esteem through social approval (status, recognition, respect, etc.) It might not only be a strong influence on the instructor-learner relationship, it may be the main reason for a learner's interest in aviation training.

> Determining where a learner is at can be helpful for addressing issues. A student who does not feel save in their home is probably not ready to pursue an activity like flying, which satisfies a need further up the pyramid.
5. **Cognitive and Aesthetic**: *This layer is added in the later years and thus not in the picture shown above.* Cognitive is the need to know and understand, to control and make informed decisions. Aesthetic are emotional needs, if an instructor does not like a learner, that subtle feeling may leak into their teaching.
6. **Self-Actualization**: Realizing one's own potential for continued development / personal goals.
7. *Help learners satisfy their needs in a manner that creates a healthy learning environment.*
