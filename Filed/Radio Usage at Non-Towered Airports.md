These are example radio calls for an arrival and departure at a non-tower airport. The exact calls will vary depending on the circumstances. Each call should include your location and altitude, and what you are doing next.

>[!tip]
> When things are confusing or non-standard, it’s OK to get "conversational" on the frequency to make your intentions clear, but try to keep the calls concise.

> [!warning]
> Notice these are "self-announce", where you say where you are and what you're doing. Statements like "any traffic in the area please advise" is poor form.

# Example Calls

## Awareness Call

10 miles out, inbound for landing

> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, ten miles north east, 3000 feet, inbound for landing, Watsonville"</span>

This is meant to inform local traffic where you are and that you're intending to land.

## Intention Call
5 miles out, closer in, when you have determined what runway other traffic is using

> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, five miles north east, three thousand feet, will overfly the airport and enter left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville"</span>

This is meant to tell local traffic where you are, and how you'll enter the pattern.

## Crossing Overhead
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, overhead at two thousand two hundred feet, teardrop to enter the left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville"</span>

You may also say "turning downwind" instead of "teardrop", although a teardrop entry is preferred.

## The pattern

### Entering the 45
For a teardrop, after flying outbound for about 2 miles, and descending to pattern altitude, on the 45 entry

> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville"</span>

> [!note]
> If you are on the 45 or downwind, you are assumed to be at pattern altitude, unless you call out something different.

### On Downwind
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, left downwind runway two zero, Watsonville"</span>

>[!tip]
> There's a case to be made that 'left' is not needed here, since everyone should know the traffic pattern direction.
> 
> However, IFR practice approaches sometimes fly opposite traffic, so it's good to get in the habit of announcing.

### On Base
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, left base runway two zero, Watsonville"</span>

### On Final
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, final approach, two zero, full-stop landing, Watsonville"</span>

## After Landing
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, exiting runway two zero (at Delta), taxiing transient parking, Watsonville"</span>

The taxiway callout is optional.

## Departing
### Taxiing for Departure
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, transient parking, taxiing runway two zero via Alpha for departure, Watsonville"</span>

It’s nice to include the taxiway if there are multiple ways to get there.

### If You Need to Cross an Intersecting Runway
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, taxiing across runway two seven at Alpha, Watsonville"</span>

### Before Taking the Runway for Departure
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, taking runway two zero, then right crosswind departure", Watsonville"</span>

> [!warning]
> You'll sometimes here "taking the active", instead of the actual runway number being taken. "The active" is unclear and a lost chance to convey useful information.

### During the Upwind Climb
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, departure leg runway two zero, then right crosswind departure, Watsonville"</span>

### On the Crosswind
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, departing right crosswind from two zero, one thousand three hundred fleet, climbing, Watsonville"</span>

### Last Call During Departure
> <span class="comm-text">"Watsonville traffic, Cessna Tango India Sierra, three miles west, two thousand seven hundred feet, climbing, departing to the west, Watsonville"</span>

> [!warning]
> You may hear "Last Call" in this sort of communication. The general consensus is this is bad practice, since saying "departing to the west" also conveys you're leaving the CTAF frequency.
