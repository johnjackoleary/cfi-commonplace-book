# Key Takeaways
- 85% of aviation accidents have been caused by "pilot error"
- When a pilot follows good decision-making practices, the inherent risk in a flight is reduced or even eliminated
- [[PAVE]], [[FRAT]], [[3P Model]], and others can help identify potential hazards of a flight and successfully mitigate the associated risks

# Details
Flight has some level of inherent risk. The goal of risk management is to proactively identify safety-related hazards and mitigate the associated risks.

## Hazards and Risks
- [[Hazard]] is a condition that could cause an accident. 
- [[Risk]] is the [[likelihood]] and predicted [[severity]] of the consequences that may result from a hazard.

> [!example] From [[Risk Management Handbook]]
> The example of a person crossing a street helps explain the relationship between hazard and risk. The traffic is always a hazard, but it does not usually create a significant risk for a pedestrian until the actual street crossing takes place.

Risk assessment depends on the pilot's experience, health, education, and many other elements.

## Preflight
### Identifying Hazards
[[PAVE]] is a great starting point to identify hazards.^[[[Complete VFR Preflight Checklist]] and [[Complete IFR Preflight Checklist]] are structured around [[PAVE]] and highlight many more specific elements.]

A pilot may also have [[5 Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes|hazardous attitudes]], which can lead to dangerous decisions while flying.

### Assessing the Level of Risk
Once hazards are identified, their associated risks need to be assessed.

A [[FRAT]] can help with this process. 
1. For each risk, write the associated likelihood and severity. 
2. Then, use a [[Risk Assessment Matrix.png|risk assessment matrix]] to determine the total risk.
3. For any risk greater than 'medium', a mitigation should be found.

For an example of this, see the #case-study in [Risk Assessment: Student Solo with Showers in the Vicinity](https://cfijack.com/risk-assessment-student-solo-with-showers-in-the-vicinity/) by [[CFI Jack]].

### Personal Minimums
For more information on the value of, and process for setting, see [[personal minimums]].

> [!quote] From [[Risk Management Handbook]]
> Managing these risks requires a conscious effort and established standards (or a maximum risk threshold). Pilots who practice effective risk management have predetermined personal minimums and have formed habit patterns and checklists to incorporate them.
> ...
> Professional pilots live by the numbers, and so should general aviation pilots.

## In-Flight 
### Handling Threats and Errors
A [[threat]] is a hazard in the enviroment that is outside the crew's control. This includes things like system failures or unexpected ATC instructions.

An [[error]], on the other hand, is a deviation from intended or expected actions and results in a reduction in safety margins. It can be an unintentional or intentional act.

> [!example]
> A [[runway incursion]] is one example of an error.

Pilots defend against threats and errors in a number of ways:
- Checklists, [[SOP]]s, and best practices
- Utilizing a second person^[Even a passenger with basic [[~ Emergency Pilot Outline|emergency pilot]] training can be an asset.] or external resources
- Clear communication^[Such as a [[SAFETY]] brief]
- Effective [[SA]] and keeping up with [[Two Most Important Things in Aviation|the next two things]]
- Automation management
- Effective [[CRM]] and [[SRM]]

These layers of defense form the Swiss cheese model to preventing and [[incident]] or [[accident]].

Some pilots employ the [[Three Strikes and Youâ€™re Out Rule]] to avoid building an accident chain. While a single decision or event may not lead to an accident, a series of events and the resultant decisions together form a chain of events leading to an outcome.

### Automation
The use and misuse of automation are significant topics in risk management.

For more information, see [[Autopilot Systems and Usage]].

### Aeronautical Decision-Making
For more information, see [[ADM]] and [[Operational Pitfalls]].

## In Comparison
The risks in aviation often look different than other fields, and decision-making may fall to one person.

> [!quote] From [[Risk Management Handbook]]
> If in doubt about risk mitigation, a pilot should consider the value of mitigation against the potential cost of property damage and loss of life. A saying goes, safety costs a lot less than an accident. In fact, risk mitigation makes long-term economic sense.
