#### After runup, ready for takeoff

| Them | You |
| ---- | --- |
|     |  "Ground, <br>Citabria 596JR, <br>Runup Complete" ^[This is a bit specific to KPAO, your airport may have its own variation on procedures.]  |
|  "Citabria Six Juliet Romeo, <br>Hold short Yankee One, <br>contact Tower".     | "hold short Yankee One, <br>contact Tower, <br> 6JR"   |
|      |  Taxi as instructed.  <br>Then contact tower for takeoff clearance: <br>"Palo Alto Tower, <br>Citabria 596JR, <br>Holding short Yankee One, <br>Ready for departure".    |
|  "Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, <br>hold short Runway Three-One"    |  "Hold short Three-One, <br>596JR"   |
| And then maybe something like: <br>"Citabria Six-Juliet-Romeo, <br>cleared for takeoff runway Three One, <br>left Dumbarton Departure, <br>follow Cessna on upwind"  |  "Cleared for takeoff runway Three One, <br>left Dumbarton Departure, <br>following Cessna, <br>Citabria 6JR" |


#### Initial call when returning for landing:

| Them | You |
| ---- | --- |

#### While flying the traffic pattern, if you don’t know your landing sequence:

| Them | You |
| ---- | --- |
|      | "Sequence, <br>Citabria Six-Juliet-Romeo" |
|   Expect reply such as: "Six-Juliet-Romeo, <br>extend downwind, <br>following Cirrus on Four mile final over Moffet, <br>I’ll call your base" (In this case, stay on downwind until Tower asks you to turn base).   |                                       |


#### After landing, taxi clearance back to parking, after switching to ground frequency (or sometimes on tower, if only one controller is working):

| Them | You |

|      |  "Palo Alto Ground, <br>Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, <br>on Zulu, <br>taxi West Valley parking"   |
