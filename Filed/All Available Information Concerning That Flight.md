[[FAR 91.103 Preflight Action]] uses the phrase "all available information concerning that flight" and it's important to understand what it means, and how to get the information it requires. A popular acronym to remember this is [[NWKRAFT]].

**The elements of NWKRAFT are:**

1. [[NOTAM]]s and [[TFR]]s (and [[Approved NOTAM Contractions]])
2. Weather reports and forecasts
	1. [[Weather Brief]]
	2. [[PIREP]]s
	3.  [[ATIS]]/[[METAR]]s (towered airports), [[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]] (non-towered)
		1. Can often call instead of using radio
		2. [[Crosswind Component]]
	4. [[TAF]]
	5. [[Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories]]
	6. [[Categorical Outlooks]]
	7. [[Area Forecast Discussion]]
	8. Webcams^[[[Useful Bay Area Webcams]]] or calling someone at the airport 
3. Known traffic delays (https://nasstatus.faa.gov/map)
4. Runway lengths
5. Available alternatives
6. Fuel requirements ([[FAR 91.151 VFR Fuel Reqs]], [[POH]])
	1. Some clubs have specific club regulations
7. Takeoff and landing distance -- aircraft performance vs airport elevation, gross weight, wind and temperatures

**The best sources for this information are:**
1. ForeFlight and other [[EFB]]s
2. https://aviationweather.gov/
3. Flight service online: [1800wxbrief.com](http://www.1800wxbrief.com)
4. Flight Service by phone: 1-800-WXBrief
5. Webcams [[Useful Bay Area Webcams]]

**When is an NWKRAFT briefing required?**
According to [[FAR 91.103 Preflight Action]], not for a VFR flight "in the vicinity of an airport".  But even for a flight in the pattern, runway lengths and takeoff/landing distance are required.  And it would be foolish not to check the [[ATIS]], [[NOTAM]]s, and the weather forecast.
