#### Key Quotes
* This InFO is issued to provide education and clarification for operators and pilots about the appropriate use and meaning, connotations and regulatory definitions of the terms “[[Minimum Fuel]],” “[[Emergency Fuel]],” and “[[Reserve Fuel]].” 
* “Minimum fuel” declarations are essentially advisory in nature to air traffic control ([[ATC]]). 
* Declare “minimum fuel” when, in your best judgment, any additional delay will cause you to burn into your reserve fuel. 
* Declare a fuel emergency at the point at which, in your judgment, it is necessary for you to proceed directly to the airport at which you intend to land. Declaration of a fuel emergency is an explicit statement that priority handling by ATC is necessary and expected.
