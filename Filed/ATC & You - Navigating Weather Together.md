A #lecture at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|Oshkosh]] 2025 by [[NATCA]].

1. [[TRACON]] and [[ARTCC]] can only see precipitation, not generic buildup.
2. [[ATC]] has an on-site meteorologist. 
3. Controllers get a full [[weather brief]] before they start each shift.
4. Feel free to ask in plain English if you don’t know proper phraseology. Don’t hesitate to ask.
5. [[PIREP]]s can be just a quick heads up to them, don’t stress the format too much. 
6. Give PIREPs of anything you would have liked to know. They'll pass it on to the next pilots.
7. Declaring the emergency: if you declare, they are also allowed to break any rule to help get you safe. Sort of like an ATC version of [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority|91.3]].
8. Required to ask for PIREPs in these situations
	- Ceilings at or below 5,000 ft
	- ﻿﻿Visibility at or less than 5 miles
	- ﻿﻿Thunderstorms and related phenomena
	- ﻿﻿Turbulence of moderate degree or greater
	- ﻿﻿Icing of light degree or greater  
	- Wind shear
	- Braking action reports
9. Average of 178 seconds until a bad outcome with [[VFR]] into [[IMC]]
	1. Famous study from [[AOPA]] [[Air Safety Institute]]
	2. More info [here](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2022/june/pilot/asi-tips-178-seconds)
10. 90% of accidents resulting from thunderstorms are fatal
11. Can request block altitude if unable to hold altitude in turbulence 
12. [[Ice Hazards and Aircraft Icing|Icing]] layers are rarely more than 3000’ thick 
13. Include [[ATC]] in your [[CRM]]
14. Can email askATC@natca.org with any questions
15. Q&A
	1. Giving you direct or shortcuts is also something ATC wants to do; no need to ask for this. They want you through their airspace faster as well.
	2. Not uncommon to get a new squawk code because there are just not that many codes available. Can’t have two planes with the same code 
	3. File IFR circuits leg-by-leg, not as a big batch
