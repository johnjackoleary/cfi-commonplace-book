***Description***      :: Interpretation on Known Icing Conditions
***Author*** :: [[FAA Office aof the Chief Counsel]]

#### Key Quotes
* The FAA believes the term "known or observed or detected ice accretion" to be synonymous with the term "known ice" and that the agency's definition of that term is non-controversial.
* "Known ice" involves the situation where ice formation is actually detected or observed. "Known icing conditions" involve instead circumstances where a reasonable pilot would expect a substantial likelihood of ice formation on the aircraft based upon all information available to that pilot.
