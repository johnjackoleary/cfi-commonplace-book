Refers to a final flow/check before crossing the runway threshold.
- **Lights**: Are the correct exterior lights on?
- **Camera**: Can ATC see me? (Meaning, is my [[transponder]] set (either [[VFR Aircraft Squawk (1200)]] or as assigned)
- **Action**: All required configurations for takeoff. E.g. mixture rich, flaps correct, etc
- **Time**: Especially important for IFR [[Lost Comms]] or [[Dead Reckoning]], but a good habit in general. What time am I departing?
