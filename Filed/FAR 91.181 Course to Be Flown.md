#### Key Quotes
* Unless otherwise authorized by [[ATC]], no person may operate an aircraft within controlled airspace under [[IFR]] except as follows:
	* On an [[ATS]] route, along the centerline of that airway.
	* On any other route, along the direct course between the navigational aids or fixes defining that route. However, this section does not prohibit maneuvering the aircraft to pass well clear of other air traffic or the maneuvering of the aircraft in [[VFR]] conditions to clear the intended flight path both before and during climb or descent.
