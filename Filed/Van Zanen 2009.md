#### Key Quotes
* In your example, a pilot wishes to fly from Airport A to Airport B, which is located 20 nautical miles (nm) to the south. The pilot then flies from Airport B to Airport C ,which is located 60nm north. The pilot then flies home a distance of 40 nm from Airport C to Airport A. You state that each of these flights had an independent purpose. If a pilot logged these flights as flight segments of one flight, that pilot would not be able to log any cross-country time because no segment includes a landing that is 50nm from the original point of departure. You ask whether the pilot may log the flight from Airport A to Airport B as one flight and the flights from Airport B to Airport C to Airport A as flight segments of a second flight.
* Accordingly, the pilot may log the flight from Airport A to Airport B as one flight (not logging cross-country time) and the flight from Airport B to Airport C to Airport A as a separate flight (logging cross-country time).
