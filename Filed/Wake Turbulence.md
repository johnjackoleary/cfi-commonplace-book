# Key Takeaways
- Heavy, clean, and slow aircraft generate the largest wake turbulence.
- To avoid wake turbulence
	- Avoid flying through another aircraft’s flight path.
	- Avoid following another aircraft at an altitude within 1,000 feet.
	- Rotate prior to the point at which the preceding aircraft rotated when taking off behind another aircraft.
	- Approach the runway above a preceding aircraft’s path when landing behind another aircraft and touch down after the point at which the other aircraft wheels contacted the runway.
- If unsure, give 3 minutes for turbulence to dissipate.

## FAA Definition
***Definition***    :: Wingtip vortices that are created when an airplane generates lift. When an airplane generates lift, air spills over the wingtips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices or wake turbulence.
