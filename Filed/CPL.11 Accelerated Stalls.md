### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with power-on and power-off stalls.

### References
- [[Commercial ACS]] Sec VII-B and -C
- [[AFH Ch5]], 
- [[PHAK Ch4]]
- [[POH]]

### Builds On
- [[CPL.10 Slow Flight and Stalls]]
- [[PPL.8 Power-On and Power-Off Stalls]]

### Schedule
0.5-hour ground, 1.0-hour flight, with practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. Stall background same as [[PPL.8 Power-On and Power-Off Stalls]]
4. Accelerated stall procedure
	1. Select practice area, check traffic, altitude 3000’ AGL minimum RECOVERY altitude.
	2. Establish 45 degree bank turn (at relatively low speed/power)
	3. Use rudder to maintain coordinated flight (ball in center)
	4. Gradual pitch up until first indication of a stall (stall horn, buffet, etc). Don’t need to do a full-stall!
	5. Recovery:
		1. Pitch down
		2. Full power
		3. Level wings (primarily rudder, ailerons also as airspeed increases)
		4. pitch up to establish climb at Vx
5. Common Errors:
	1. Starting maneuver at too-high airspeed, causing lots of time, climb, and /or g-force to get to the accelerated stall.
	2. Not maintaining rudder coordination, causing wing to drop during stall, entering spin!
	3. Delay in stall recovery, causing excessive altitude loss or spin entry
	4. Secondary stall due to aggressive pitch up during recovery

### Completion Standards
Client must be able to demonstrate accelerated stalls to [[Commercial ACS standards]]. Recovery no lower than 1500’ AGL, maintain heading ±10° before stall, or specified bank angle ± 5°, recognize stall and recover promptly with proper procedure.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
#todo :: TBD

### Required Homework
None
