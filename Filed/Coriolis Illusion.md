***Definition***    :: In a prolonged turn, the ear canal and fluid inside will settle. With an abrupt head movement, the pilot can send fluids moving in an entirely different axis, giving the illusion of performing a maneuver they are not.
***Mitigation***: Use minimal head movement in instrument scans, and use minimal head movements if something must be retrieved from the ground.
