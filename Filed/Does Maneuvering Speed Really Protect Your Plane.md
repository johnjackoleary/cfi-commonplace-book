#### Key Quotes
* It turns out that at or below Va, you'll stall before you break, but only if you: Move a **single** flight control, in **one direction** only, in **smooth air.** If it's turbulent, or if you roll and pitch and kick the rudder, all bets are off.
* If you're flying at your certified Va speed, but you're below max gross weight, you'll fly at a lower angle of attack. As you pull back and increase Gs, you'll hit your G limit before you reach the critical angle of attack.
