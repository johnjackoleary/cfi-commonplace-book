# Key Takeaways
- Is the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take off of aircraft.
- Planning and preparation are the best mitigations for runway incursions

# Details
#### Example
In 2017 at an airport in Orange County (KSNA), Harrison Ford accidentally landed on taxiway Charlie, to the left of runway 20L. A Boeing 737 was holding short of 20L on the taxiway when Ford overflew them.

From *[Aviation International News](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/general-aviation/2017-05-16/faa-opts-out-punishment-harrison-ford-taxiway-landing)*:
> After a long period of silence [after landing]—about two minutes—on the recording, Ford asks: “Tower, 9HU, was that airliner airplane supposed to be underneath me?”
> 
> The controller responded: “N89HU, negative, he’s holding short of 20L, you landed on Charlie.”
> 
> ...
> 
> After Ford was cleared to taxi to the Signature East FBO, he was told, “And Husky 9HU, possible pilot deviation, and I need you to call the tower, advise when you have a pen ready to copy a number.” He acknowledged then copied the tower phone number.

#### Risks and Mitigations
**Risks:**
- "Although vehicles, pedestrians, and air traffic controllers are responsible for some incursions, pilot deviations are cited in more than 60% of all incursion events. If we drill down further, we’ll also see that ***incursions are largely a general aviation problem*** with more than half occurring in GA operations conducted under 14 CFR part 91." - [[Runway Safety]]
- Several factors lead to runway incursions:
	- lack of situational awareness (unfamiliar airport or airport markings)
	- distractions (chatty passengers or being heads down with an electronic device)
	- fatigue (physical or mental)

**Mitigations:**
In short: better planning and preparation.
#todo :: add sterile cockpit
- Understand airport diagram and likely taxi routes through airport
- Review and understand [[Filed/Hotspot|hotspots]], which can be found in airport diagrams ([[KSNA Airport Diagram with Hotspots.pdf|example]]), the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) ([[KSNA Hotspot Descriptions.jpeg|example]]), and instrument approach books
- Know and watch for runway hold position markings ([[Runway Hold Position Marking.png|image]]). If you haven't been cleared to cross it (or you aren't sure), hold short and ask.
- If in doubt about your route or where you are: **STOP!** It's ok to ask the controller or request [[progressive taxi]] instructions.
