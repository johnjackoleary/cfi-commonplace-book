***Key Quotes***:
* this chapter focuses on the approach to landing, factors that affect landings, types of landings, and aspects of faulty landings
* A careful pilot knows that the safe outcome of a landing should never be in doubt. Pilots who respect their own limitations are able to approach each landing with confidence and achieve the satisfaction that comes from successful aircraft control.
* A go-around is a normal maneuver that is used when approach and landing parameters deviate from expectations or when it is hazardous to continue.
* Intentional slips... are used to dissipate altitude without increasing airspeed and/or to adjust airplane ground track during a crosswind.
