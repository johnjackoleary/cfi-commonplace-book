| Hazardous Attitude  | Meaning                | Antidote                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Anti-Authority**^[This attitude is found in people who do not like anyone telling them what to do. In a sense, they are saying, "No one can tell me what to do." They may be resentful of having someone tell them what to do or may regard rules, regulations, and procedures as silly or unnecessary. However, it is always pilot prerogative to question authority if it seems to be in error.]  | Don't tell me.         | Follow the rules. They are usually right.  |
| **Macho**^[Pilots who are always trying to prove that they are better than anyone else are thinking, "I can do it, I’ll show them." Pilots with this type of attitude will try to prove themselves by taking risks in order to impress others. While this pattern is thought to be a male characteristic, women are equally susceptible.]           | I can do it.           | Taking chances is foolish.                 |
| **Invulnerability**^[Many people believe that accidents happen to others, but never to them. They know accidents can happen, and they know that anyone can be affected. They never really feel or believe that they will be personally involved. Pilots who think this way are more likely to take chances and increase risk.] | It won't happen to me. | It could happen to me.                     |
| **Impulsivity**^[This is the attitude of people who frequently feel the need to do something—anything—immediately. They do not stop to think about what they are about to do; they do not select the best alternative; and they do the first thing that comes to mind.]     | Do it quickly.         | Not so fast. Think first.                  |
| **Resignation**^[Pilots who think, "What’s the use?" do not see themselves as being able to make a great deal of difference in what happens to them. When things go well, the pilot is apt to think that it is good luck. When things go badly, the pilot may feel that "someone is out to get me," or attribute it to bad luck. The pilot will leave the action to others, for better or worse. Sometimes, such pilots will even go along with unreasonable requests just to be a "nice guy."]     | What's the use?        | I'm not helpless. I can make a difference. |


> [!example] From [[AC 60-22]] Hazardous Attitude Inventory Test
> You are 40 minutes late for a trip in a small airplane. Since the aircraft handled well on the previous day's flight, you decide to skip most of the preflight check. What leads you to this decision?
> 
> **a.** You simply take the first approach to making up time that comes to mind.
> **b.** You feel that your reputation for being on time demands that you cut corners when necessary.
> **c.** You believe that some of the preflight inspection is just a waste of time.
> **d.** You see no reason to think that something unfortunate will happen during this flight.
> **e.** If any problems develop, the responsibility would not be yours. It is the maintenance of the airplane that really makes the difference.
