> [!tip] From Jack 
> I ran into a [[DPE]] once while refueling and asked for teaching tips. He recommended this exercise to teach hold entry:
> 1. Get a paper plate, and draw a right-turn hold on one side and a left-turn hold on the other
> 2. Throw the dinner plate like a frisbee
> 3. Have the student walk to the plate, and figure out the proper hold entry while they approach
