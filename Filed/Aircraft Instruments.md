# Key Takeaways
- "Six-pack" refers to the six round instruments in the middle of the panel
- Instruments operate on different systems for redundancy
- Proper use and interpretation are key to safe operation

## Pitot-Static System and Instruments
> [!youtube] [Pitot-Static Instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdFGbUouE_4) from [[ERAU SpecialVFR]]

1. Ram air vs. static air
2. Airspeed
3. Altimeter
4. Vertical Speed Indicator
5. Pitot-Static Failures
	1. Use and impact of alternative static usage^[Jack always struggled to remember how alternate static impacted static pressure. Recently, he heard a story of an old, disagreeable man who owned a lake resort. He wanted his ashes to be scattered over the lake, so when he died, they took a small plane and poured out the ashes. But, since the air pressure in the cabin is lower than outside, all the ashes were pulled back into the airplane. Thus, he continued to be a pain even after death. Also, alternate static inside the cabin is lower than normal pressure outside.]
	2. Pitot Heat

## Gyroscopic Instruments (Vacuum- and Electric-Driven)

1. Characteristics of a gyroscope - precession and rigidity in space
2. Vacuum Driven
	1. Attitude Indicator
	2. Directional Gyro
3. Electrically Driven
	1. Turn Coordinator

## Magnetic Compass
> [!youtube] [Aircraft Magnetic Compass Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dDKjdj_Dvc) from [[ERAU SpecialVFR]]

1. Construction
2. [[Compass Errors]]: [[Magnetic Variation|Variation]], [[Magnetic Deviation|Deviation]], [[Magnetic Dip]] and Acceleration Errors

## AHRS and ADC
1. [[AHRS]] generally replaces the gyroscopic instruments
2. [[ADC]] generally replaces the pitot-static instruments
