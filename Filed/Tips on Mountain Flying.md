#### Key Quotes
* Mountain flying opens up new opportunities for the general aviation pilot for unique and interesting destinations, plus a view of spectacular scenery.
* However, mountain flying, even more so than flight in the flatlands, is very unforgiving of poor training and planning.
* This publication is not intended to be a complete mountain flying training course. Instead, it can be used as an overview before you take recognized training or a review afterward.
