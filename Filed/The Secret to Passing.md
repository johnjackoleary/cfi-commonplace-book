#### Key Quotes
* So, how in the world are you supposed to prepare for this thing? It’s not as hard as it seems. You just have to ask questions as you go, and make sure you understand why you are learning each thing and how it will apply to real life flying.
* For example, on a checkride, I never start out by saying, “And now, please demonstrate your emergency descent.” Instead, I say something like, “I see flames coming out the right side of our engine cowling.”
