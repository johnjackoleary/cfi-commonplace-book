Note: I could not find the original document source, which surprises me. It was "Copyright 2010, Experimental Aircraft Association, Inc.", so perhaps they have it deeper into the EAA website than I could find.

***Key Quotes***:
* The purpose of this guide is to serve as a handy reference for those aviation educators who wish to teach under the light sport rules.
* One of the crucial things for a [[CFI]] to understand is that, except for in very rare circumstances, you don’t need any new certification to train [[sport pilot]]s. You already have all the necessary qualifications.
