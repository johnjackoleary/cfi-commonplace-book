# Key Takeaways
- Adhering to the starter duty cycle prevents damage to the starter
- Typically a starter can be engaged for a specific number of seconds, followed by some short cooldown time
- After a set number of attempts, the starter must cool down for a more significant time

> The starter cranks the engine for starting while the battery supplies the power. The engine does not always start on the first attempt so significant heat is generated in starter components which require a limitation to the number of cycles which can be made before a cool down period must be applied, this is called the "Duty Cycle".
