The Dot Game is a way to practice holds by framing it from ATC's perspective.

Given some scenario, what would ATC see you doing on their radar screen? And remember, you don't have much time. (Definitely not enough time to draw it out!)

> [!example]
> Flying southbound on V25 from TAILS, you receive this clearance from ATC: "Hold south-east at EUGEN as published. Expect further clearance in 15 minutes."
> 
> What would ATC see you doing on their screen?
> 
> The answer should sound with something like: 
> 
> *Continue down V25 until crossing EUGEN. My current heading is 144, and the outbound course is 309-180=129^[some people find it easier to do 309-200+20]. The published hold is left turns, so the teardrop entry applies for an outbound course between 144 and 144-70=74.^[Consider the thumb trick from [[Holding Procedures#Hold Entries]], and visualize the teardrop/parallel/direct sectors that way.] Our outbound course of 129 is between those, so use a teardrop. Upon crossing EUGEN, I'll turn to heading 129+30=159, fly for 1 minute, then left turn to the inbound course of 309^[reciprocal of the outbound course] to fly inbound to EUGEN. From there, I'll turn after crossing EUGEN to heading 129, then hold using 1-minute legs.*

> [!example]- Flying northbound from WRING on V459: "Hold north-west at TTE on radial 230"
> Current heading is 327, and outbound course is 230. Parallel entry for our heading, since 230 is between 327 and 217. After crossing TTE, I'll turn left to 230, fly for 1 minute, then turn left again to heading 95 to intercept the inbound course of 50. As the CDI centers, I'll turn inbound on heading 50. After reaching TTE, I'll make right turns with 1-minute legs.

> [!example]- Flying northbound from WRING on V459: "Hold north-west at TTE on radial 230, left turns"
> Current heading is 327, and outbound course is 230. Direct entry for our heading, since 230 is beyond the teardrop sector between 327 and 257. After crossing TTE, I'll turn left to 230, fly for 1 minute, then turn left again to the inbound heading 50. After reaching TTE, I'll make left turns with 1-minute legs.
