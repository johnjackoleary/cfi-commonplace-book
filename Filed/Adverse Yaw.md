***Definition***    :: A bank is achieved by deflecting ailerons, which causes more lift on the rising wing than the lowering wing. More lift causes more drag, and so the nose tends to yaw to the outside of the turn^[If not corrected, this is a [[slipping turn]]]
***Remedies:*** Use rudder to keep coordinated.
