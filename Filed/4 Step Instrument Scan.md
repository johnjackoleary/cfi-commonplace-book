#### Key Quotes
* A good instrument scan procedure means that the pilot is always looking at meaningful information. Telling a student to "keep your eyes moving and scan all the instruments" does not fulfill this objective. That action will cause you to look at nonessential information, which wastes time, causes poor performance, and decimates self-confidence.
* Students with slow eye movement performed best. They usually knew when and where to look for the task at hand, and when eye movement stopped, they were always looking at the attitude indicator. These pilots were relaxed and they had more time for proper aircraft management.
