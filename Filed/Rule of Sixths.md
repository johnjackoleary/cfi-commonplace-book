A #rule-of-thumb for determining [[crosswind component]].

Add 1/6 for each 10° of crosswind, up to 60°. Then multiply by the total wind to find the approximate crosswind component.

So for a 20° crosswind:

$$
\frac{2}{6} * wind = crosswind
$$

This is simple enough to use in flight while keeping a reasonable amount of precision.

| Angle | Sine | Rule of Sixths | Decimal |
| ----- | ---- | -------------- | ------- |
| 10    | 0.17 | 1/6            | 0.16    |
| 20    | 0.34 | 2/6            | 0.33    |
| 30    | 0.5  | 3/6            | 0.5     |
| 40    | 0.64 | 4/6            | 0.66    |
| 50    | 0.77 | 5/6            | 0.83    |
| 60    | 0.86 | 6/6 = 1        | 1       |
