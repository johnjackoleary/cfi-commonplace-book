Higher density altitude means lower aircraft performance.

When outside is high, hot, and (to a much lesser extent) humid -- density altitude will be higher and aircraft performance is worse.

Remember: [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]

***Definition***    :: Pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature. Density altitude is used in computing the performance of an aircraft and its engines.
***In Other Words:*** The altitude the aircraft 'thinks' it's flying at.
