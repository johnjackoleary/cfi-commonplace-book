***Definition***    :: A black-hole approach occurs when the landing is made from over water or non-lighted terrain where the runway lights are the only source of light.
***Additional Details***: Without peripheral visual cues to help, orientation is difficult. The runway can seem out of position (down-sloping or up-sloping) and in the worst case, results in landing short of the runway. If an electronic glide slope or visual approach slope indicator ([[VASI]]) is available, it should be used
