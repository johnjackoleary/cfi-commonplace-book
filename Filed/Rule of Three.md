> Take the amount of altitude you want to lose in thousands. For example, if you’re cruising at 7,500 feet to an airport with an elevation of 1,500 feet, you’ve got 6,000 feet to lose. Multiply six (from 6,000) times three (this is why they call it the rule of threes) and you get 18—the distance in nautical miles at which you should start your descent.
