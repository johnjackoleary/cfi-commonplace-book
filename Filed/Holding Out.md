Broad advertising is by definition Holding Out.  But even having a reputation for being willing to transport people is considered Holding Out.  However issuing an invitation to a defined and limited group of people with whom you have pre-existing relationships is not Holding Out (See [[AC 61-142]], Section 10.2.1)

> A carrier becomes a common carrier when it "holds itself out" to the public, or to a segment of the public, as willing to furnish transportation within the limits of its facilities to any person who wants it.
