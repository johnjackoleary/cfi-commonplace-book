> ADM is a systematic approach to risk assessment and stress management. To understand ADM is to also understand how personal attitudes can influence decision-making and how those attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the flight deck. It is important to understand the factors that cause humans to make decisions and how the decision-making process not only works, but can be improved.

> The steps leading to this decision constitute a decision-making process. Three models of a structured framework for problem-solving and decision-making are the [[5P Model|5P]], the [[3P Model|3P]] using [[PAVE]], [[CARE]] and [[TEAM]], and the [[DECIDE]] models.

### DECIDE
1. Detect that a change has occurred
2. Estimate the need to counter or react to the change
3. Choose a desirable outcome
4. Identify actions which could successfully control the change
5. Do.  Take the necessary action
6. Evaluate the effect of the action countering the change

### 3P
1. Perceive the current set of circumstances for the flight
2. Process by evaluating their potential impact on flight safety
3. Perform by implementing the best course of action
