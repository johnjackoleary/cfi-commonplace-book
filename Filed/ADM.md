# Key Takeaways
- While closely related to [[risk management]], ADM primarily addresses in-flight decisions
- The [[5P Model]] can be used to assess all aspects of a decision
- The [[3P Model]] can be used to make a good, time-critical decision
- Some situations require automatic decision-making based on training and experience

# Details
> [!note] From [[PHAK Ch2]]
> ADM is a systematic approach to risk assessment and stress management. To understand ADM is to also understand how personal attitudes can influence decision-making and how those attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the flight deck. It is important to understand the factors that cause humans to make decisions and how the decision-making process not only works, but can be improved.
> ...
> The steps leading to this decision constitute a decision-making process. Three models of a structured framework for problem-solving and decision-making are the [[5P Model|5P]], the [[3P Model|3P]] using [[PAVE]], [[CARE]] and [[TEAM]], and the [[DECIDE]] models.

## Evaluating the Situation (5Ps)
A pilot must know the areas that present challenges and opportunities while flying. The [[5P Model]] helps itemize these areas, and should be reviewed at key times of a flight.^[Before boarding, prior to takeoff, etc] 

> [!summary] The 5Ps
> 1. The Plan
> 2. The Plane
> 3. The Pilot
> 4. The Passengers
> 5. The Programming

By considering each of these, a pilot can make the appropriate decision required by the current situation.

## Time-Critical Decisions
Most decisions a pilot makes are time-sensitive. Depending on the circumstances, either **analytical decision-making** or **automatic decision-making** may be more appropriate.

### Analytical Decision-Making
If time allows, such as in an [[urgency]] condition, the [[3P Model|3P]] or [[DECIDE]] model can be used.

#### 3P
3P is simpler and often favored in practice.

> [!summary] 3Ps
> 1. **Perceive** the current set of circumstances for the flight
> 2. **Process** by evaluating their potential impact on flight safety
> 3. **Perform** by implementing the best course of action

Each of Perceive, Process, and Perform have their own acronyms to ensure completeness.

1. Perceive with [[PAVE]]: Pilot, Aircraft, Environment, External Pressures
2. Process with [[CARE]]: Consequences, Alternatives, Reality, External factors
3. Perform with [[TEAM]]: Transfer, Eliminate, Accept, Mitigate

> [!warning] A good rule of thumb for the processing phase
> If you find yourself saying that it will “probably” be okay, it is definitely time for a solid reality check

#### DECIDE
DECIDE is more complete and emphasizes the feedback loop inherent to good decision-making.

> [!summary] DECIDE
> 4. **Detect** that a change has occurred
> 5. **Estimate** the need to counter or react to the change
> 6. **Choose** a desirable outcome
> 7. **Identify** actions which could successfully control the change
> 8. **Do**.  Take the necessary action
> 9. **Evaluate** the effect of the action countering the change

### Automatic/Naturalistic Decision-Making
When time is not available, experts match the situation to their past experiences. This allows them to clarify options quickly and select a workable option.

This naturalistic or automatic decision-making improves with training and experience. It is also more susceptible to [[operational pitfalls]].
