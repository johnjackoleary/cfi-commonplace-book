> Visual Flight Rules are common operating procedures to manage risk, select courses of action, and evaluate behavior. The most important underlying assumption (and part of the legal requirement) of VFR is that we can look out the window and see stuff ([[VMC|Visual Meteorological Conditions]]), especially the ground. Suppose we can't look out the window and see anything or only a few things ([[IMC|Instrument Meteorological Conditions]]). In that case, the same rules won't work to successfully manage risk, select courses of action, and evaluate behavior. While that's obvious to us, the implications aren't necessarily obvious to someone approaching [[VFR]] and [[IFR]] for the first time. This difference affects almost everything we do, including; preflight planning and inspection, what equipment we have, legal requirements, navigation, communication, flying traffic pattern, avoiding other traffic, which routes we plan, where we fly, the control inputs we use to fly, the risks involved in our flight, etc. ad nauseam.
