> I teach students not to fight trim when approaching to land by trimming the airplane for the final approach speed on the downwind leg. We do this by experimenting to see how much each notch of flaps slows us down.
> 
> If the first notch slows us by ten knots, the second notch ten knots, and the third notch five knots, we will add twenty-five knots to our target final approach speed and trim for that speed on the downwind leg.

> Adding the flaps throughout the approach requires no additional trimming, and the airplane slows to the final approach speed with minimal effort.
