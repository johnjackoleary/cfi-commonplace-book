***Meaning*** :: <u>T</u>erminal <u>A</u>erodrome <u>F</u>orecast
***Definition***    :: report established for the five statute mile radius around an airport. TAF reports are usually given for larger airports. Each TAF is valid for a 24 or 30-hour time period and is updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. The TAF utilizes the same descriptors and abbreviations as used in the METAR report.

From [[Flight and Ground Instructor Pro-Tips]]
> I impress my students when doing one-on-
one training that TAF should stand for "Tiny" 
Aerodrome Forecast. The terminal area is so 
small that meteorologists consider a TAF a 
point forecast. It's not a zone or area forecast 
and should never be used as such. Forecasters 
will often hedge their bets because of this. 
For example, when thunderstorms are more 
isolated or scattered in coverage, you may not 
see a forecast for thunderstorms in the TAF. The 
chances are just too low due to the small size of 
the forecast area. But you may see SHRA (rain 
showers) or VCSH (showers in the vicinity) as a 
placeholder to cover the threat of 
thunderstorms in these uncertain situations. 
Remember, showery precipitation describes a 
convective process.
