| Displacement       | A student get frustrated during learning how to program a G1000 for an approach in a simulator and treats simulator with excessive force out of frustration.                                                                |
| Denial             | The airplane student took on a solo flight was left untied on the ramp. When you point it out to the student, they denies it or try to minimize and say "well, the airplane is still there."                                |
| Rationalization    | A student failed their knowledge exam and instead of admitting to failing to spend adequate time and doing practice tests, they attribute it to a bad luck: "the question happened to be all in my weak areas."             |
| Compensation       | A student just flew a terrible departure procedure, and instead of reflecting on it, they started to talk about how good they are at approaches.                                                                            |

| Fantasy            | A student with a goal of becoming an airline pilot felt frustrated that they're not making progress, instead of focusing on getting over the plateau, they start to talk about how the airline pilot's life is going to be. |
| Repression         | Some students has repressed fear of flying and while they don't talk about it, it might inhibits their ability to take control of the situation. Such as freezing during stalls, landing, etc.                              |
