# Key Takeaways
- To descend below DA/DH/MDA, must have three things:
	1. Continuously in a position to land with normal rate and normal maneuvers^[This is where a [[VDP]] can help]
	2. Sufficient visibility for this [[IAP]]
	3. At least 1 of 12 allowed visual references
- The 12 visual references can be grouped as:
	1. Odds and Ends: 
		1. **[[ALS]]**, but only to [[TDZE]]+100' unless red terminating bars in sight
		2. **[[REIL]]**
		3. **[[VGSI]]**
	2. **Threshold**, threshold markings, or threshold lights
	3. **Touchdown zone**, touchdown zone markings, or touchdown zone lights
	4. **Runway**, runway markings, or runway lights

# Details
