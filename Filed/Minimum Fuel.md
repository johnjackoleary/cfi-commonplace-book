***Definition***    :: Indicates that an aircraft’s fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching the destination, it can accept little or no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.
***Additional Info:*** Declare “minimum fuel” when, in your best judgment, any additional delay will cause you to burn into your reserve fuel.
