#### Key Quotes
* A [[Stabilized Approach]] is one in which the pilot establishes and maintains a constant angle [[glidepath]] towards a predetermined point on the landing runway.
* Moreover, the probability of being unstable can DOUBLE as you increasingly fly above a “3:1” flight path profile.
* A method to estimate the appropriate descent rate in feet/minute to maintain a 3° glidepath is to multiply the groundspeed in knots by 5.
