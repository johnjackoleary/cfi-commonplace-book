1. [[Indicated Altitude]]: altitude you read directly off your altimeter
2. [[Pressure Altitude]]: altimeter reading when you set it to 29.92 inches Hg
3. [[Density Altitude]]: pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature
4. [[True Altitude]]: vertical distance of your airplane above sea level, commonly expressed as "feet [[MSL]]"
5. [[Absolute Altitude]]: Constantly changing, absolute altitude is the distance measurement of your airplane above the ground, expressed in "feet [[AGL]]" (above ground level)^[This is also what [[radar altimeter|radar altimeters]] measure]
