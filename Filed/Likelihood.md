> [!example] From [[Risk Management Handbook]]
Consider the likelihood of exceeding airframe structural limits if penetrating a thunderstorm. It is likely that the airframeâ€™s structural limits would be exceeded each time this occurs, making the likelihood "probable."

> [!example] From [[Risk Management Handbook]]
Consider a case where a pilot operates at an airport surrounded by rough terrain. The runways are just long enough to accommodate the aircraft. The possibility exists for a runway overrun on each landing. Given this data, an overrun could occur sometime, and the likelihood is "occasional."
