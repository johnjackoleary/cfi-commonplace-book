# Key Takeaways
- [Icing](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/icing_stuff/icing/icing.htm) from [[weather.gov]] does an excellent job summarizing the theory
- [[Aircraft Icing]] does an excellent job summarizing the impact on aircraft
- Regardless of anti-ice or deice protection offered by the aircraft, a pilot’s first course of action should be to leave the area of visible moisture. 
	- This might mean descending to an altitude below the cloud bases, climbing to an altitude that is above the cloud tops, or turning to a different course. 
	- If this is not possible, then the pilot should move to an altitude where the temperature is above freezing.

## How Icing Affects the Airplane
> [!quote] From [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
> Structural icing degrades an aircraft’s performance. It destroys the smooth flow of air, increasing drag while decreasing the ability of the airfoil to create lift.^[The actual weight of ice on an airplane is insignificant when compared to the airflow disruption it causes.]

Ice can form on any exposed surface, and different locations cause different issues. See [[Aircraft Icing]] for more details e.g. tail stalls.

## Types of Icing
- [[Rime Ice]]
- [[Clear Ice]]
- [[Mixed Ice]]
- [[SLD]]
- [[Frost]]

## Accumulation Rates

| Intensity | Rate                | Necessary Actions                     |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Trace     | less than ¼ inch/hr | Continued flight possible with limits |
| Light     | ¼-1 inch/hr         | Continued flight not recommended      |
| Moderate  | 1-3 inch/hr         | Diversion necessary                   |
| Severe    | 3+ inch/hr          | Immediate diversion required          |
| [[SLD]]   | ++                  | Immediate diversion required          |

Up to moderate ice, you can fly into it with a plane that is certified for [[FIKI]] (following the proper procedures for the airplane).

| Intensity | Effects^[[Icing](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/icing_stuff/icing/icing.htm) from [[weather.gov]]] |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trace     | Usually not hazardous even if de-icing/anti-icing equipment is NOT used                                                  |
| Light     | Occasional use of de-icing/anti-icing equipment removes/prevents accumulation                                                                                                                         |
| Moderate  | Rate of accumulation is such that event short encounters become potentially hazardous and use of de-icing/anti-icing equipment or flight diversion is necessary                                                                                                                         |
| Severe    | De-icing/anti-icing equipment fails to reduce or control the hazard. Immediate flight diversion is necessary|                                                                                                                         |

## Categories of Aircraft Icing
- Structural Icing: Icing on aircraft structures.
- Induction System Icing
	- Air intake icing and alternative intake solutions
	- [[How and Why Carburetor Ice Forms|Carburetor Icing]]
- Instrument Icing
	- Icing on pitot tube, antennas, etc.

## Icing Avoidance
### Icing Conditions
In general, any time^[This is really common advice, but Jack could not find a specific source for it. Please let me know if you have one.]
1. outside air temperatures of +10°C or less, and 
2. visible moisture is present

Certain fronts and atmospheric structures are more likely to cause icing conditions.

Typically, ice only forms within a 2000-3000' layer, so descending may help. (Climbing may also help, but also increases the risk of [[SLD]].) A key initial goal is to stop the accumulation.

### Flight Into Known Icing Conditions
Aircraft certified for [[FIKI]] need to have specific tests completed. All equipment must be functional to fly into known icing conditions.

> [!question]- There is a PIREP for light icing along your intended route. Can you fly a C172 there?
> No, under no circumstances, since it is not certified for [[FIKI]].
> 
> For more on known ice vs known icing conditions, see [[Bell 2009]].

## Equipment
- Anti-icers prevent ice from forming
	- Pitot heat
	- Carburetor heat
	- Windshield defroster
	- Fluids released from leading edge of propeller or wing
- De-icers remove ice after formation
	- Rubber boots to crack ice that's formed
- You may be able to knock some ice from a constant-speed propeller by varying the pitch
