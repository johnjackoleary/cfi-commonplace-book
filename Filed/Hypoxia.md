# Dangers
Hypoxia is extremely dangerous for pilots.  Side effects include impaired judgement and decision-making; decreased response time; visual impairment; and eventually, unconsciousness.  For these reasons, pilots need to be extremely vigilant to detect and avoid hypoxia.

# Types of Hypoxia
1. **Hypoxic Hypoxia**: Not enough available oxygen.  This is most common in pilots flying at higher altitudes
2. **Hypemic Hypoxia**: Oxygen is available, but the body is not able to take it up.  Carbon Monoxide poisoning falls in this category.
3. **Stagnant Hypoxia**: This is due to a blockage that keeps oxygen from flowing. The classic example is an arm or leg "falling asleep".
4. **Histotoxic Hypoxia**: The inability of cells to make use of the oxygen delivered to them, often due to alcohol or drugs.

# Detection

## Symptoms 
1. Impaired judgement and decreased response time!
2. Headache
3. Euphoria
4. Visual Impairment
5. Drowsiness
6. Lightheaded
7. Lips and fingernails: blue for hypoxic hypoxia; red for carbon monoxide poisoning

> [!Note] Numbers 1-5 are the same as [[Hyperventilation]]

## Tools
1. Pulse Oxymeter
2. Carbon Monoxide monitor

# Avoiding Hypoxia
> [!quote] From [[AIM 8]]
> For optimum protection, pilots are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above 10,000 feet during the day, and above 5,000 feet at night.
