1. Readiness
	1. The basic needs of the learner need to be satisfied before they are ready or capable of learning. (See [[CFI1.1 Human Behavior]])
	2. Instructor should communicate clear set of objectives and relate each new topics to those objectives to keep learners in "ready-state". For [[Scenario-Based Training]], the instructor should also keep the task as meaningful and within learner's capabilities as well.
	3. Make use of the *teachable moment*. (ex. When the instructor sees a deer cross the runway on final, they use the moment to teach go-around is always an option.)
2. Effect
	1. Behaviors that lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated; The learner needs to have success in order to have more success in the future.
	2. The instructor's job is to  create situations to promote success.
3. Recency
	1. Things most recently learned are best remembered.
	2. This principle often determines the sequence of lectures.
4. Intensity
	1. Immediate, exciting, or dramatic learning connected to a real situation teaches a learner more than a routine or boring experience.
	2. Use of [[Scenario-Based Training]] helps with this.
5. Primacy
	1. What is learned **first**, often creates a strong, almost unshakable impression.
	2. It is important to teach correctly the first time.
6. Exercise
	1. "Use it or lose it"
	2. Exercise is most meaningful and effective when it is practiced in the context of a real-world application
