A #memory-aid for which order to change throttle and propeller controls in some [[high performance]] aircraft.

**Power Up**: Make a seven from the bottom up. Start from cowl flaps (open), up to prop (forward), then throttle (up).
**Power Down**: Make a seven from the top down. Start with throttle (back), prop (back), cowl flaps (as needed).
