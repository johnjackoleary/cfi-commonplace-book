# Key Takeaways
- Based primarily on [[VOR]], [[DME]], and [[ILS]]
- Intended as a resilient [[PBN]] backup to [[Satellite Navigation using GPS and GNSS]]^[https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices]

# Details
## VOR
### Types of VOR
1. [[VOR]]
2. [[VOR]]/[[DME]]
3. [[VORTAC]]

### How VOR Works
#todo :: add a bit more, especially with the [graphic from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range#/media/File:VOR_principle.gif)

### Using VOR
1. tuning and identifying
2. interpreting instrument and relative location
3. intercepting and tracking
4. flying direct to

### Common Issues
> [!warning] 
> VHF transmissions require line-of-sight

#todo :: add more info on intercepting, tracking, and accounting for wind. can pull some of this from #ir lessons
#todo :: fill this out more, maybe including practice problems (like https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/5101/files/Holding.pdf?1141 from thebackseatpilot.com)
#todo :: add more info on ILS
#todo :: add info about MON
#todo :: consider adding info about [[ADF]]
