# Details

Simple examples from [[CFI PRO-TIPS]]
Evolution of Navigation 
Systems. (Disclaimer, I'm going to be a bit 
liberal with the physics in this example; the 
principle is what's relevant.) Under VFR, 
our primary forms of navigation are 
pilotage and dead reckoning. Using 
pilotage, we look out the window and 
determine position based on what we see. 
But what if we were going to fly across a 
body of water, like a Great Lake or the Gulf 
of Mexico (you can come up with other 
examples)? Suppose we were flying across 
Lake Superior from Terrace Bay Airport in 
Terrace Bay, Ontario, to Luce County 
Airport near Newberry, Michigan, in the 
middle of the lake. In that case, everything 
we can see looks like everything else! How 
could we help ourselves in that situation?
What if somebody in Newberry was playing 
music very, very, VERY loudly, and we could 
hear it from 100 miles away in the airplane? As 
the music got louder, we would know we were 
getting closer; if the music got quieter, we were 
going further away. Could we play the music on 
a radio station and we could receive that station 
in the airplane? The closer we got to Newberry, 
the more we could hear the music; the farther 
from Newberry, the worse we could hear the 
music. However, we can't see any land while 
over the water. 

Even if we get turned around, we would 
know if we're getting closer to, farther from, or 
not changing range to the destination. What if 
we could invent a device that, instead of playing 
the music to us in the cockpit, could point at 
where the music is coming from? We've just 
created a rudimentary Non-Directional Beacon, 
and now we can point toward Newberry 




## VOR
### Types of VOR
1. [[VOR]]
2. [[VOR]]/[[DME]]
3. [[VORTAC]]

### How VOR Works
#todo :: add a bit more, especially with the [graphic from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range#/media/File:VOR_principle.gif)

### Using VOR
1. tuning and identifying
2. interpreting instrument and relative location
3. intercepting and tracking
4. flying direct to

### Common Issues
> [!warning] 
> VHF transmissions require line-of-sight

#todo :: add more info on intercepting, tracking, and accounting for wind. can pull some of this from #ir lessons
#todo :: fill this out more, maybe including practice problems (like https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/5101/files/Holding.pdf?1141 from thebackseatpilot.com)
#todo :: add more info on ILS
#todo :: add info about MON
#todo :: consider adding info about [[ADF]]
