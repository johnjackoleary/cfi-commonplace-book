***Description***      :: Failure to Comply with Minimum Crossing Altitudes at Stepdown Fixes Located on Instrument Landing System ([[ILS]]) Inbound Courses 
***Author*** :: [[FAA]]

#### Key Quotes
* you could follow the same glide slope and (because the temperature is hotter this day) those same stepdown altitudes now protrude into the glide slope and require pilot action to ensure compliance with the published minimum altitudes (stepdown fixes)
* . If a pilot elects to follow the glide slope while outside the Final Approach Segment he should be fully aware that this technique needs to be closely monitored and, if necessary, action must be taken to meet all stepdown altitudes
