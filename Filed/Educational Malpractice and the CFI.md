A #lecture at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|Oshkosh]] 2025 by S.V. "Steve" Dedmon from [[ERAU]].

1. In general, a discussion of Grady v. Aero-Tech Services 2021
2. Good write-up here: https://www.flyingmag.com/court-ruling-brings-sigh-of-relief-to-flight-schools-cfis-but-not-immunity/
3. The court held that the FAA regulations set the standards here, and it's not the court's place to decide if that is sufficient.
4. As a [[CFI]], we're governed by the [[FAR]]s and (at least from this ruling) as long as training complies with these, it is sufficient.
