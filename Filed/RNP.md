***Meaning*** :: <u>R</u>equired <u>N</u>avigation <u>P</u>erformance

A navigation specification under the [[PBN]] umbrella that includes accuracy requirements and monitoring/alerting capabilities.
    
For example, RNP 1 means the aircraft must stay within 1 nautical mile of the intended path 95% of the time, and deviations must be monitored and alerted onboard.
    
Unlike basic RNAV, RNP requires aircraft systems to detect and alert the crew if the navigation performance degrades.

The U.S. [[GPS]] system by itself is not an RNP system. But with addition of [[RAIM]], GPS becomes an RNP system.
