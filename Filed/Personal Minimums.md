> In fuel calculations, you wouldn’t dream of planning a flight that would force you to use your reserve fuel, or (worse) take you to the “unusable fuel” level in the tanks. In skill calculations, you shouldn’t consider making a flight that requires use of skills at the “reserve” or (worse) “unusable fuel” level of your piloting ability.

# Using Your Personal Minimums
There are several formats for personal minimums. Two common approaches are absolute minimums^[Not an official term, as far as Jack can tell. #todo :: find official term] and risk stacking^[Not an official term, as far as Jack can tell, but referenced in [this writeup](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2022/august/pilot/what-went-wrong-risk-stacking) from [[AOPA]]. #todo :: find official term].

## Absolute Minimums
Some pilots prefer to set minimums that are absolute minimums: if the conditions violate any line item, then the flight is a no-go.

This makes [[ADM]] simpler in some ways, since minimums can be used just like any other checklist. It may not capture the nuance of go/no-go decision though.

[[Getting the Maximum from Personal Minimums]] is an example of this style of minimums.

## Risk Stacking
Personal minimums can also be considered as input to a total risk equation. Any one item may not make the flight too risky, but 2+ (or even one significant item) would make the flight a no-go.

> [!example]
> Flying in [[MVFR]] may normally be the edge of your personal minimums, so it adds additional risk. If you were additionally flying a new airplane, these two risks stack and you may decide no-go.

There are a few flavors of this approach. Generally, counting up risk factors to a general limit or tallying your experience to compare with mission difficulty.

[[AIH AppD]] is an example of counting risk factors:
> [!quote] 
> Be wary if you have an item that’s marginal in any single risk factor category. But if you have items in more than one category, you may be headed for trouble. If you have marginal items in two or more risk factors/categories, do not go! 

[General Flight Guidelines from Cirrus](https://cirrusaircraft.com/knowyourlimits/) is an example of tallying your experience to compare to mission difficulty.^[This Cirrus tool is a helpful reality check on your level of experience, but isn't as useful for actual go/no-go decisions. Jack as found it most useful when reflecting on personal minimums for use with [[Getting the Maximum from Personal Minimums]] or [[AIH AppD]].]


## Adjustments for Unusual Circumstances
Some pilots include adjustments to their minimums based on particular circumstances, for instance if they are fatigued or in a new aircraft. Check out [[Getting the Maximum from Personal Minimums]] for examples of this.

# Instrument Minimums
Pilots typically set different minimums for instrument conditions and [[IFR]] flight.

> [!quote] From [[Flight and Ground Instructor Pro-Tips]]: *Set Personal Minimums* by Sho Akiyama
> Most pilots understand it is not intelligent to do [[Zero-Zero Takeoff|"zero-zero" take-off]]. I teach my [[IFR]] students that my personal minimum is the ceiling and visibility that will allow a safe return to the departure airport (or a nearby departure alternative). When the student was a low-time IFR pilot, I advised her to raise the minimum to either a non-precision level or a circling minimum level to depart that airport.

# Additional Suggestions
## Wind
> [!quote] From [[AOPA]]'s [Too Windy?](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/1998/march/pilot/too-windy)
> When the blow exceeds 20 knots, you must be on top of your game, and above 25 knots is for serious players only.

For additional methods to find your wind minimums, see [[Personal Minimums for Wind]].

## Night VFR as a New Pilot
> [!quote] From [[PHAK Ch2]]
> The accident rate during night visual flight rules ([[VFR]]) decreases by nearly 50 percent once a pilot obtains 100 hours and continues to decrease until the 1,000 hour level. The data suggest that for the first 500 hours, pilots flying VFR at night might want to establish higher personal limitations than are required by the regulations and, if applicable, apply instrument flying skills in this environment.

## Physio-Minimums
> [!quote] From [[Flight and Ground Instructor Pro-Tips]]: *Physio-minimums* by Chris Schlanger
> Set concrete physio-minimums for yourself and share them with your students. What's the minimum sleep you need? What's the latest/longest you'll go since you last slept? What's the longest you can go without eating? 
> 
> Should you set a maximum work duration that gives you enough energy to fly? We spend almost all our time on weather minima, yet we often blow through [[IMSAFE]] with little more than "I'm good." That's ridiculous.
> 
> Fatigue is our most significant risk and, by definition, a blind spot. Approach it with as much rigor as you would any other risk. In [[PAVE]], Pilot comes first.
