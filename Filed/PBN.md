***Meaning*** :: <u>P</u>erformance <u>B</u>ased <u>N</u>avigation

In an effort to separate requirements from solutions, the FAA refers to "Performance Based Navigation" as any technical solution that allows navigation to random locations with specific accuracy. 

PBN is an ICAO-defined concept that specifies **how aircraft should navigate**, based on performance requirements rather than specific ground-based navigation aids (like VORs or NDBs).

GPS is the most common PBN system, but there are others, such as DME/DME.
