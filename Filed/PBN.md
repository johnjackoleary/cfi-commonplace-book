***Meaning*** :: <u>P</u>erformance <u>B</u>ased <u>N</u>avigation

In an effort to separate requirements from solutions, the FAA refers to "Performance Based Navigation" as any technical solution that allows navigation to random locations with specific accuracy. 

PBN is an ICAO-defined concept that specifies **how aircraft should navigate**, based on performance requirements rather than specific ground-based navigation aids (like VORs or NDBs).

GPS is the most common PBN system, but there are others, such as DME/DME.

> Performance Based Navigation is the initiative to shift away from requiring certain navigation types (such as VOR, NDB, etc.) and instead requiring a navigation performance requirement using whatever navigation means achieves the required performance.

> The required performance can be measured in terms of RNAV or RNP. The only difference being is that RNP requires performance/integrity monitoring, i.e. a system that will tell you when your require navigation performance is not being met.

> RNAV 1, RNAV 2, RNAV 5, RNAV 10 are all navigation specifications that have their own particular requirements outlined in ICAO Doc 9613. Simply put, the numbers represent the lateral accuracy required in nautical miles.

> Same for RNP 1, RNP 2, RNP 4, etc, but requires integrity monitoring. Remember, it’s not just lateral accuracy. Each NavSpec has its own requirements beyond the simple lateral accuracy. See the ICAO Doc 9613.

> RNP APCH navspec is the equivalent of RNAV (GPS), and RNP AR APCH is the equivalent of RNAV (RNP). A-RNP simply means a system that can automatically and properly switch between navspecs where necessary, etc etc, you get the idea.

> The term “RNAV” and “RNP” must be used in context. Because in other context they mean different things. RNAV by itself simply means area navigation, which can be achieved through various navigation types. This is not to be confused with “RNAV” navigation specifications mentioned above. Same with RNP. Context matters.
