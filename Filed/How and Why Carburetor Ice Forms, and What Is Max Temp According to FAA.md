[[Float-Type Carburetor]]'s are susceptible to icing. This is due to to cooling effects of and sharp temperature drop from:
1. fuel vaporization
2. the decrease in air pressure in the venturi

If there is moisture in the air, it can condense on internal surfaces of the carburetor, including the throttle valve.

Carburetor icing is most likely to occur at temperatures below 70°F and the relative humidity of >80%. However, ice may form in temperatures as high as 100°F and humidity as low as 50%.
