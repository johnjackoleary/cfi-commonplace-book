> When planning takeoff from short unobstructed runways, establish a landmark at 50% of your calculated takeoff distance. When reaching that landmark, you should be at 70% of your rotation speed. If not, abort the takeoff and reduce weight or wait for more favorable wind and temperature conditions.

> Even if this model were correct, performance that barely results in a "'go" decision means the wheels would lift off in the last foot of runway. Any way you slice it, the 70-50 rule is just plain dangerous.
