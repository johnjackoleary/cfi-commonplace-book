#### Key Quotes
* Flying over mountains can offer beautiful scenery and views you just can’t get from the ground. Whether it’s the Rockies, the Appalachians, or the Alps, mountain flying is often an unforgettable experience. 
* However, keep in mind that mountain flying also involves more risks than flying over the flatlands.
