***Definition***    :: A vertical attraction between a compass needle and the magnetic poles. The closer the aircraft is to a pole, the more severe the effect.
***Additional Details***: The Earth's magnetic field runs parallel to its surface only at the Magnetic Equator, which is the point halfway between the Magnetic North and South Poles. As you move away from the Magnetic Equator towards the magnetic poles, the angle created by the vertical pull of the Earth's magnetic field in relation to the Earthâ€™s surface increases gradually. This angle is known as the dip angle.
