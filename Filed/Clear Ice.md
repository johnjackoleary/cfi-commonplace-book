***Definition***    :: Clear ice (or glaze ice) is a glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large, supercooled water droplets.
***Additional Information***: 
- Clear ice forms when only a small portion of the drop freezes immediately while the remaining unfrozen portion flows or smears over the aircraft surface and gradually freezes. 
- Clear icing is a more hazardous ice type for many reasons.
