#### Key Quotes
* the regulation requires that the operator contact the specific ATC facility responsible for the Class C airspace in question. In the case of Class C airspace, that facility is the Terminal Radar Approach Control ([[TRACON]]).
* In your hypothetical, you inquired whether a pilot would be in violation of section 91.130(c)(1) if he enters the Class C airspace while in two-way communication with the Center and not the TRACON. You further inquired if the Center's "failure to hand him off" would relieve the pilot of the responsibility to establish two-way communication with the TRACON prior to entering their Class C airspace. The operator of the aircraft would be ni violation of section [[FAR 91.130 Class C Ops|91.130]](c)(1) in the hypothetical that you present.
