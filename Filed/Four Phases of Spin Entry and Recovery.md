Four Phases of Spin
?
1. Entry
	1. Similar to a power-off stall. When approaching stall, apply rudder full in direction of desired spin.
2. Incipient
	1. Lasts about 4 to 6 seconds in light aircraft
	2. Approximately 2 turns
3. Developed 
	1. Airspeed, VS, and rotation rate all stabilized
	2. Small, training aircraft loose ~500ft per 3-second rotation^[500ft/3sec * 60 sec/min = 10,000 ft/min!]
4. Recovery
	1. [[PARE]]
	2. Wings regain lift
	3. Training aircraft usually recover in about 1/4 to 1/2 turns after inputs applied
