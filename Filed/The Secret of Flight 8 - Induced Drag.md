#### Summary
* [[Induced Drag]] explained using smoke chamber.
* Explains why high [[aspect ratio]] wings are used (and better for) highly economical planes, since they produce less surface friction and more widely distribute the pressure below and above to reduce [[Wingtip Vortex|wingtip vortices]].
* In cruise flight, 50% of power goes to overcoming air resistance and 50% goes to generating [[lift]].
