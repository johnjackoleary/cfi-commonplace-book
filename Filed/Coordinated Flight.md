***Definition***    :: Coordinated flight occurs whenever the pilot is proactively correcting for yaw effects associated with power (engine/ propeller effects), aileron inputs, how an airplane reacts when turning, and airplane rigging. The airplane is in coordinated flight when the airplaneâ€™s nose is yawed directly into the relative wind and the ball is centered in the slip/skid indicator.
