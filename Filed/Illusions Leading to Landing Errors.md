## Runway Illusions
> [!tip] Anticipation of this illusions, and using a [[VGSI]], can help combat them.

- **Upslope/Downslope Runway**: Upsloping runway or terrain may make the aircraft seem higher than it is, resulting in a lower approach. A downslope has the opposite effect.
- **Wide/Narrow Runway**: Narrower runway may make the aircraft seem higher than it is, resulting in a lower approach. A wide runway has the opposite effect.^[[[Rod Machado]] has a video that can help avoid a high roundout on a wide runway: ["The Runway Expansion Effect"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JfoZERqM7Q)]

## Environmental Illusions
- **Featureless Terrain / [[Black-Hole Approach]]**: Night, water, snow, or similar terrain can give the illusion of flying higher than the aircraft is.
- **[[Tabletop Runway]]**: 
- **Atmospheric**: Rain can give the illusion of greater height, and haze the illusion of greater distance. Penetration of fog can look like pitching up.
- **Ground Lights**: Road or train lights may be mistaken for [[Airport Lighting|airport lights]]. Bright [[ALS]] may appear closer, making the inattentive pilot fly higher.
