A #lecture at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|Oshkosh]] 2025 from Bill Ross of Superior Air Parts.

Much of this information is also available in his book, "[Engine Management 101](https://superiorairparts.com/resources-and-events/news-and-articles/engine-management-101/)".

1. Just like a [[PPL]], an [[A&P]] is a license to learn
	1. In practice, this means a new A&P or [[IA]] still has more to learn
2. Questions to consider asking a new mechanic
	1. Do you have current technical data for my engine? Do you have current technical data for my aircraft?
		1. There isn't an excuse for not having these
	2. Do you have calibrated equipment like torque wretches, gauges, etc
	3. Do you have [[Lycoming]], etc. specific training?
3. Different mechanics will have different specialties
4. An aside on [[torque]]: Can think of a bolt as a spring being stretched. The amount of torque sets the amount of stretch, and it needs to be stretched properly.
