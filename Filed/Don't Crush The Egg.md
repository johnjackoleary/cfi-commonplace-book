A memory aid for which order to change throttle and propeller controls in a [[high performance]] aircraft.

Imagine the throttle lever is attached to the firewall, and the propeller lever is attached to the propeller. Also imagine (though not true) pushing each forward moves the firewall or propeller forward, and pulling back move them back.

Finally, imagine there's an egg between the two walls. Your job is to not crush the egg. (In other words, you should never push the throttle forward until you push the propeller forward first, and you should not pull the propeller back until you pull the throttle back.)
