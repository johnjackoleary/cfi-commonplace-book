A memory aid for which order to change throttle and propeller controls in a [[high performance]] aircraft.

- Imagine the throttle lever is attached to the firewall, and the propeller lever is attached to the propeller. (See image below.) 
- Also imagine (though not true) pushing each forward moves the firewall or propeller forward, and pulling back moves them back.
- Finally, imagine there's an egg between the two walls. 

Your job is not to crush the egg. (In other words, you should push the propeller forward before pushing the throttle, and you should pull the throttle back before pulling the propeller.)
