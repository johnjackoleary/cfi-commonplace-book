Consider what you'll do if you have an issue arise during takeoff.

This may change depending on the particulars of the airport you're departing from, but generally should consider 4 portions of the takeoff.

For example:

| Phase                | Response                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ground Roll          | Power Idle; Brake; Taxi Off                                                                |
| Lift Off             | Power Idle; Land; Brake; Taxi Off                                                          |
| Out of Usable Runway | Pitch for [[Vg\|Best Glide]]; Land Ahead                                                   |
| After Safe Altitude     | Pitch for [[Vg\|Best Glide]]; 180° Turn (45° bank, likely into wind); Land Back at Airport |
