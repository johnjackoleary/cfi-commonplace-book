## Impact on Flight
### Maneuvering Speed ([[Va]])
[[Maneuvering speed]] is: `= [[Maneuvering Speed]].definition`

Put another way, maneuvering speed (Va) is meant to ensure the airplane stalls before exceeding the [[load limit factor]].

In level flight, we're at 1G [[load factor]]. If we double, triple, or quadruple the angle of attack, we increase our G-force by double, triple, or quadruple.

If we increase our G-force beyong the [[load limit factor]]

ince at higher weights we need more lift, we need to fly at a higher [[angle of attack]]. 

For another explanation, see [[Why Maneuvering Speed Changes With Weight]]

One helpful tool here for reasoning this is a [[Vg Diagram]].

### Fuel Burn
Increased weight requires more lift to counteract, thus more engine power goes to generating [[Lift]] then to generating [[thrust]]. This reduction in forward power means more fuel is required to fly a given distance.
