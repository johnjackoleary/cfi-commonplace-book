## Impact on Flight
### Maneuvering Speed ([[Va]])
[[Maneuvering speed]] is: `= [[Maneuvering Speed]].definition`

Put another way, maneuvering speed (Va) is meant to ensure the airplane stalls before exceeding the [[limit load factor]].

In level flight, we're at 1G [[Load Factor]]. If we double, triple, or quadruple the angle of attack, we increase our G-force by double, triple, or quadruple.

If we increase our G-force beyond the [[limit load factor]], we can cause structural damage. So we need to ensure we don't want to exceed +3.8 Gs.

But, since at higher weights we need more lift, we need to fly at a higher [[angle of attack]]. Below maneuver speed, 4x-ing that angle of attack would cause a stall by exceeding the critical angle of attack. At the same airspeed and a lower weight, we'd cruise at a lower angle of attack, and 4x-ing that angle may not cause a stall.

For another explanation, see [[Why Maneuvering Speed Changes With Weight]]

One helpful tool here for reasoning this is a [[Vg Diagram]].

### Fuel Burn
Increased weight requires more lift to counteract, thus more engine power goes to generating [[Lift]] then to generating [[thrust]]. This reduction in forward power means more fuel is required to fly a given distance.
