#### Key Quotes
* A classic example of why this shouldnâ€™t be assumed can be found on the [ILS RWY 6](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=00890IZLZ6.PDF) approach into Teterboro, New Jersey. This procedure features a mandatory altitude of 1,500 at DANDY, as shown by the lines above and below the altitude. If a pilot were to descend on the glidepath instead, he would cross DANDY at about 1,965 feet
