# Key Takeaways
- [[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms|91.185]] defines the process to follow if you loss comms
	- In VMC, continue the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable
	- In IMC, use [[AVE-F]], [[MEA (Lost Comms)|MEA]], and know when to leave your [[clearance limit]]
- It's helpful to decouple the regulatory expectations and the reality of a given situation
- ***Be predictable!*** 

# Details
## Basic Flow
1. [[Squawk 7600]]
2. Debug the comms problem
	1. Try both radios (Com1, Com2)
	2. Try left and right headsets, which are each triggered by their own PTT switch
	3. Are headset plugs securely inserted?
	4. Do you see 'TX' on transmit? If not, you may have a stuck mic, or a bad PTT switch
	5. Consider calling [[TRACON]] or Center on your cell phone!
	6. Consider using a backup handheld radio
3. In [[VMC]], continue VFR, land as soon as practicable. 
4. In [[IMC]]: 
	1. For Route, use mnemonic [[AVE-F|AVE-F]] – Assigned, Vectored, Expected, then Filed (in that order of priority) 
	2. For Altitude **on each route segment**, use highest of mnemonic [[MEA (Lost Comms)]] – Minimum IFR altitude, Expected, Assigned 
	3. Leave [[Clearance Limit]]^[See also [[How Far Can You Go]]]
		1. When at fix from which approach begins, leave at EFC time if given, otherwise commence descent as close as possible to ETA
		2. When not at a fix from which approach begins, leave clearance limit at the EFC time if received and proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA. Otherwise upon arrival over the clearance limit, proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA

## Reality of Lost Comms
There is a lot of debate about lost comms in a real flight. If it's an emergency, [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority|91.3]] gives the pilot the authority to deviate from the rules to get down safely.

Many pilots would consider losing radio contact in IMC an emergency. The AIM also groups it under the emergency procedures ([[AIM 6]]). However, the FAA has been less committed in their answer.

> [!caution]
> If you use your [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority|91.3]] authority to deviate from [[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms|91.185]], **do so in a predictable way** so ATC can accommodate. For example, if an [[IAP]] is along the route, you could decide to hold over the IAP for several minutes to allow ATC to clear traffic away, then start your approach (instead of flying to your clearance limit).

> [!tip] On your checkride
> The [[DPE]] is a representative of the FAA, and on the checkride they are looking for a deep understanding and ability to apply [[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms|91.185]]. 
> 
> The correct answer, on a checkride, is what the regulation says -- it is better to avoid discussing [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority|91.3]] unless the DPE brings it up.
