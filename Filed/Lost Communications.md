# Key Takeaways
![[IFR Radio Comm Part 2 Two-Way Radio Failure.jpeg]]

# Details
1. [[Squawk 7600]]
2. Debug the comms problem:
	1. Try both radios (Com1, Com2)
	2. Try left and right headsets, which are each triggered by their own PTT switch
	3. Are headset plugs securely inserted?
	4. Do you see 'TX' on transmit? If not, you may have a stuck mic, or a bad PTT switch
	5. Consider calling [[TRACON]] or Center on your cell phone!
	6. Consider using a backup handheld radio
3. In VMC, continue VFR, land as soon as practicable. 
4. In IMC: 
	1. For Route, use mnemonic [[AVE-F|AVE-F]] – Assigned, Vectored, Expected, then Filed (in that order of priority) 
	2. For Altitude on each route segment, use highest of mnemonic [[MEA (Lost Comms)]] – Minimum (MEA), Expected, Assigned 
	3. Leave Clearance Limit^[See also [[How Far Can You Go]]]
		1. When at fix from which approach begins, leave at EFC time if given, otherwise commence descent as close as possible to ETA
		2. When not at a fix from which approach begins, leave clearance limit at the EFC time if received and proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA. Otherwise upon arrival over the clearance limit, proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA
