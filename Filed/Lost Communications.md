# Details
1. [[Squawk 7600]] 
2. Consider calling [[TRACON]] or Center!
3. In VMC, continue VFR, land as soon as practicable. 
4. In IMC: 
	1. For Route, use mnemonic [[AVE-F|AVE-F]] – Assigned, Vectored, Expected, then Filed (in that order of priority) 
	2. For Altitude on each route segment, use highest of mnemonic [[MEA (Lost Comms)]] – Minimum (MEA), Expected, Assigned 
	3. Leave Clearance Limit^[See also [[How Far Can You Go]]]
		1. When at fix from which approach begins, leave at EFC time if given, otherwise commence descent as close as possible to ETA
		2. When not at a fix from which approach begins, leave clearance limit at the EFC time if received and proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA. Otherwise upon arrival over the clearance limit, proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA
