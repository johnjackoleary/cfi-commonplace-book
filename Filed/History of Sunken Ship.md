Following her sale, she served as a floating restaurant in lower San Francisco Bay during the depression years of the 1930s. In February 1944, the Navy repurchased the ship and partly sank her in the mud flats of [[San Francisco Bay]], south of the [[San Mateo Bridge]], where Army and Navy aircraft carried out bombing runs with dummy bombs.
Portions of the wreck remain above the waterline to this day. She is commonly referred to as the "South Bay Wreck" and many tide tables reference her as a calculation point.
