Summarized from [[PHAK Ch17]].

Altitude-Induced Decompression Sickness (DCS) describes a condition characterized by a variety of symptoms resulting from exposure to low barometric pressures that cause inert gases (mainly nitrogen), normally dissolved in body fluids and tissues, to come out of physical solution and form bubbles.

DCS after scuba diving is a significant risk.  Recommendations:
- After diving, wait at least 24 hours before flying
- The wait can be reduced to 12 hours if
	- The flight is at or below 8000', and
	- The dive did not involve a controlled ascent
