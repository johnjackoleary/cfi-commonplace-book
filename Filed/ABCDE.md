A memory aid checklist for executing an emergency landing.

***Meaning*** :: <u>A</u>irspeed, <u>B</u>est Landing Spot, <u>C</u>hecklist, <u>D</u>eclare, <u>E</u>xecute

**Details**: 
- **Airspeed** - Establish best glide speed ([[Vg]]), which maximizes your landing options^[Best glide is often achieved by just flying wings level with the horizon. See [Best Glide Simplified](https://pilotworkshop.com/tips/best-glide-simplified/) for more info.]
- **Best Landing Spot** - Survey the area and choose one^[Hopefully you already had one in mind! Some people think of this like [[Tarzan Swinging Vine to Vine]]]
	- Turn there immediately!
	- Land INTO the wind!
	- If altitude allows: GPS NRST - what is closest airport?
	- If you identify a better place on the way, can change this. But should turn to best known option right away.
	- #rule-of-thumb: Can glide 1.5 NM per 1000 feet altitude in C152/C172S (see also [[POH]])
		- Can zoom GPS to this range en route
- **Checklist** for engine restart
	- Flow from memory, then...
	- Back it up with the checklist
- **Declare** - 
	- [[Squawk 7700]]
	- Tell ATC you're declaring an emergency^[Can declare on [[Emergency Frequency]] or with whomever you're already talking to]^[They may ask follow-up questions. Remember to [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]], and feel free to ignore them if it helps focus.]
- **Execute** - Follow the engine failure and emergency landing checklist. Generally:
	- Survival statement ("I'm a glider pilot, I'm going to land this plane.")
	- Secure fuel and electrical systems^[Primary sources of fire]
	- Prepare the cabin
	- Get to key point @1000' AGL: Spiral descent down, then rectangular pattern (if altitude permits) ![[Key Position for Power Off 180.jpeg]]
