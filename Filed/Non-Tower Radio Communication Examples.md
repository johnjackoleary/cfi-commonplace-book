These are example radio calls for an arrival and departure at a non-tower airport. The exact calls will vary depending on the circumstances. Each call should include your location and altitude, and what you are doing next. If you are on the 45 or downwind, you are assumed to be at pattern altitude, unless you call out something different.

When things are confusing or non-standard, it’s OK to get "conversational" on the frequency to make your intentions clear, but try to keep the calls concise.

1. **Awareness Call (~10nm)** - Initial call, inbound for landing: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, ten miles north east, 3000 feet, inbound for landing, Watsonville"*
2. **Intentions Call (~5nm)** - Next call, closer in, when you have determined what runway other traffic is using: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, five miles north east, three thousand feet, will overfly the airport and enter left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville"*
3. Crossing overhead: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, overhead at two thousand two hundred feet, will teardrop then enter left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville"* **OR**  *"Watsonville...two hundred feet, will enter direct left base runway two zero, Watsonville"*
4. (For teardrop entry) After flying outbound for about 2 miles, and descending to pattern altitude, on the 45 entry: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville"*
5. On the downwind: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, left downwind runway two zero, Watsonville"*
6. On base leg: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, left base runway two zero, Watsonville"*
7. On final: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, final approach, two zero, full-stop landing, Watsonville"*
8. After landing: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, exiting runway two zero at Delta, taxiing transient parking, Watsonville"* (Note: The taxiway callout is optional.)
9. Taxiing for departure: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, transient parking, taxiing runway two zero via Alpha for departure, Watsonville"* (Note: It’s nice to include the taxiway if there are multiple ways to get there.)
10. If you need to cross an intersecting runway: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, taxiing across runway two seven at Alpha, Watsonville"*
11. Before taking the runway for departure: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, taking runway two zero, then right crosswind departure”, Watsonville"*
12. During the upwind climb: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, departure leg runway two zero, then right crosswind departure, Watsonville"*
13. On the crosswind: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, departing right crosswind from two zero, one thousand three hundred fleet, climbing, Watsonville"*
14. Last call during the departure: *"Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, three miles west, two thousand seven hundred feet, climbing, departing to the west, Watsonville"*
