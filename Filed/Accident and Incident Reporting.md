# Key Takeaways
- [[Part 830]] requires immediate notification for any aircraft [[accident]] or an more serious [[incident]] from a specific list.
- [[Part 830]] requires a report within 10 days for an [[accident]], but only requires a report for an [[incident]] if the [[NTSB]] requests one.

# Details
> [!tip] From Jack
> I found it helpful to think of this from [[NTSB]]'s perspective:
> - They want to know immediately about an [[accident]] or a specific serious [[incident]]. So, they ask for immediate notification on a variety of things.
> - They may or may not want a report from you as well.
> 	- For an [[accident]] they say: *"Yes, give us a report always"*
> 	- For an [[incident]] they say: *"Maybe, we'll let you know if we want one"*

[[Part 830]] also includes information about how to notify [[NTSB]] and what information to include.
