This is a complete list of all preflight actions and checks (everything the pilot should do prior to starting the engine) as required either by regulation or best practice.^[At least, as complete as we could get it!]  We recommend that the student distill this into a personal checklist for daily use.

## Pilot
- [ ] [[IMSAFE|I.M.S.A.F.E.]]
- [ ] Government-Issued ID, Pilot License, and Medical Certificate[^med] in your possession (§ [[FAR 61.3|61.3]])

- [ ] Checkride or Flight Review in the past 24 months (§ [[FAR 61.56 Flight Review|61.56]])
- [ ] Recent Flight Experience for carrying passengers (§ [[FAR 61.57 Recent Flight Experience|61.57]])
- [ ] [[Personal Minimums]] met
## Aircraft
- [ ] Overall, the PIC is responsible for verifying airworthiness (§ 91.7, § 91.403)
- [ ] [[AR(R)OW]] (§ 91.9, § 91.203)
- [ ] Seat adjusted, cabin organized
- [ ] POH-specific preflight inspection completed[^insp]
- [ ] Weight and Balance within limits
- [ ] Confirm sufficient fuel, with reserves
- [ ] All required equipment operational
	- [ ] FAA-required
		- [ ] Day VFR: [[A TOMATO FLAMES]] or [[A GOOSE A CAT]]  (§ [[FAR 91.205 Instrument and Equipment Requirements|91.205]])
			- [ ] Additional info on Emergency Location Transmitter (ELT) (§ 91.207)
			- [ ] Additional info on position lights (§ 91.209)
		- [ ] Night VFR adds: [[FLAPS]] (§ [[FAR 91.205 Instrument and Equipment Requirements|91.205]])
		- [ ] Transponder Requirements (§ 91.215)
	- [ ] Manufacturer-required: See [[Kinds Of Equipment List]]
	- [ ] Process for determining if equipment is required: [[FAR 91.213 Inop Equip]]
- [ ] All required inspections complete ("[[AAV1ATE]]")

## Environment
- [ ] VFR weather minimums are met locally, at the destination, and everywhere in between
- [ ] [[All Available Information Concerning That Flight]]

## External Pressure
- [ ] Don't let yourself be rushed
- [ ] Don't go if something's not right
- [ ] Consider the [[Three Strikes and You’re Out Rule]]

## Flight Planning
- [ ] Complete a navlog planner, with waypoints, altitudes, fuel requirements, etc.
	- [ ] Consider performance requirements (eg. climb rates to clear terrain)
	- [ ] Consider all airspaces, terrain, and obstacles en route
- [ ] Call ahead to each airport to check on fuel, transient parking, and FBO costs
- [ ] File VFR Flight Plan (if desired)
- [ ] Be prepared for diversion (money)

## Other
- [ ] Provide passengers with [[SAFETY]] briefing
- [ ] Carry necessary materials, such as VFR charts; flashlight for night flight; emergency supplies like water, food, and first aid kit
