#### Key Quotes
* This advisory circular ([[AC]]) provides guidance for operators to conduct Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 97 instrument flight rules ([[IFR]]) Area Navigation ([[RNAV]]) Global Positioning System ([[GPS]]) instrument approach procedures ([[IAP]]) with localizer performance with vertical guidance ([[LPV]]) and localizer performance without vertical guidance ([[LP]]) lines of minima using the wide area augmentation system ([[WAAS]]).
* **Contingency Procedures**. Pilots must be familiar with the fail-down capability of their WAAS integration.
	* Example: LPV or LP lines of minima approach not available due to reduced WAAS service.
* Example: Complete GPS service outage or avionics malfunction. When a GPS
service outage occurs all RNAV (GPS) approaches will be out of service.
