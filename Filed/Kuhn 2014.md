***Description***      :: logging flight time for [[CPL]] when completing certain requirements with instructor onboard
***Author*** :: [[FAA Office of the Chief Counsel]]

#### Key Quotes
* You asked several questions concerning crediting required flight time under ยง [[FAR 61.129 CPL Experience Reqs|61.129]](a)(4) by performing the duties of pilot in command ([[PIC]]) in a single engine airplane with an authorized instructor on board instead of performing this required flight time as solo flight time.
* Because this flight time is a substitute for solo flight time, the pilot is not receiving instruction and therefore cannot log this time as dual instruction received.
