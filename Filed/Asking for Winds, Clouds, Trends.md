Found this a useful way to frame weather when going for flights in the local area.

## Sample Request to Student for Pre-Lesson Weather Analysis

Check out the available weather resources, especially the TAFs at SFO, OAK, SJC, and LVK to build a picture of the different conditions around the bay.

We’d want ceilings of at least 1500’ to do pattern work (technically 1300’ gives us 500’ clearance below clouds at TPA for SQL, but in practice I find less than 1500’ is pushing it, and even that is pretty low). Gusty conditions are not preferred, but workable. We could go to SQL, PAO, HAF, HWD, OAK, or LVK. (note: getting to LVK requires higher ceilings over Sunol since we’ll cross the ridge there.)

Send me your thoughts on if we should plan to keep the flight, and if so, where you’d like to go.
