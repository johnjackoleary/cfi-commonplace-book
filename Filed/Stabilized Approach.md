***Definition***    :: A pilot is flying a stabilized approach when he or she establishes and maintains a constant angle glidepath towards a predetermined point on the landing runway.
***Additional Info:*** Every runway is unique, but a commonly referenced optimum [[glidepath]] follows the “3:1” principle. The principle, also seen as a descent ratio, means that for every 3 nautical miles (nm) flown over the ground, the aircraft should descend 1,000 feet. This flightpath profile simulates a 3° glideslope.
