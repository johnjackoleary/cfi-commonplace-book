***Definition***    :: This National Weather Service product is intended to provide a well-reasoned discussion of the meteorological thinking which went into the preparation of the [[Zone Forecast Product]]. The forecaster will try to focus on the most particular challenges of the forecast. The text will be written in plain language or in proper contractions. At the end of the discussion, there will be a list of all advisories, non-convective watches, and non-convective warnings. The term non-convective refers to weather that is not caused by thunderstorms. An intermediate Area Forecast Discussion will be issued when either significant forecast updates are being made or if interesting weather is expected to occur.

forecast discussions. Forecasters that issue 
these TAFs also issue an Area Forecast 
Discussion or AFD. However, they don't discuss 
the retired aviation area forecast or the 
Graphical Forecast for Aviation (GFA). They

office's county warning areas (CWAs). 
They are a great way to read what the 
forecaster is thinking and trying to assess this 
kind of uncertainty. The same forecaster that 
issues the TAFs for airports in their respective 
CWA produces the AFD
