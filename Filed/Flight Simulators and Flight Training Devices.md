The FAA defines 4 different categories of devices that we might casually call "flight simulators". From most advanced to least advanced:

| Name                              | Acronym | Description                                                                                                                                         | References |

| (Full) Flight Simulator           |         | Generally includes motion simulation                                                                                                                |            |
| Flight Training Device            | FTD     | A device representing a specific airplane's cockpit and systems. Often used for obtaining a type rating                                             |            |
| Advanced Aviation Training Device | [[AATD]] | Offers more complex training than a BATD. Configurable to simulate specific aircraft. **The PFC1000 devices found at West Valley Flying Club are AATDs** | AC 61-136B |
| Basic Aviation Training Device    | [[BATD]] | Less complex than an AATD  | AC 61-13B |
