***Definition***    :: When mountain waves are present, it is quite common for a rotor zone to develop near or below ridge level on the downwind side of the mountain, under a wave crest and associated lenticular cloud (if sufficient moisture is present). This is an area of potentially severe-to-extreme wind shear and turbulence.
