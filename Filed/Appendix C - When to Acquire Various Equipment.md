Before First Flight:
- Logbook

Soon After Starting:
- Headset
- Bag
- SFO [[TAC]]
- Kneeboard (simple is fine, nice if it has info like light gun signals)
- [[Ground School]] Subscription (or other plan for ground school)

Before Starting XC:
- SFO Sectional
- Plotter
- E6B
	- Electronic is fine, whiz-wheel also ok if you're excited about it
	- Consider buying used -- this is mostly important for the knowledge test. We can use an online E6B otherwise.

Before Night Flights:
- Headlamp with red light
- Backup flashlight (preferably red)
