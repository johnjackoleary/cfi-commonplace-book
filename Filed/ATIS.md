#acronym

ATIS is an hourly broadcast, recorded by the control tower, giving useful weather information plus any info they want all pilots to know. Each hourly recording is given a letter. By telling the tower you have the latest information (eg. "landing with information Hotel"), you save them the trouble of repeating all that information for you.

Why is each element of the ATIS useful to you?

1. time -> Is this the current broadcast? When is the next one?
2. winds -> Which runway should I plan for?
3. visibility -> Is it good enough to land?
4. ceiling -> Can I get through the clouds?
5. temp/dewpoint -> Is the airport likely to fog over soon?
6. altimeter -> gotta set that when you switch to tower/CTAF frequency
7. notices -> Is there anything special I should be aware of?
