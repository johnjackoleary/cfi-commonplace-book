## Spin Awareness and Spin Recovery

**Objective:** Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with spins, flight situations where unintentional spins may occur, and procedures for recovery from unintentional spins.
**References:** ACS Sec VII-D, AFH Ch 4, PHAK Ch 5, POH, AC 61-67C
**Builds On:** [[Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]
**Schedule:** 0.5-hour ground, 1.0-hour flight
**Lesson Elements:** 
1. Aerodynamics of spins
	1. Spins are stalls, but with one wing "more stalled" than the other, causing rapid autorotation and descent. The nose may be pointing near the ground, but angle of attack is high, airspeed is slow, and descent rate is moderate.
	2. At spin entry, trying to lift the down wing with aileron deepens the stall and accelerates stall entry!
	3. Relationship to CG -- If CG is too far aft (e.g. aft of utility category limits) spin may not be recoverable!
