ACS Tasks:
1. Normal Takeoff and Climb (IV.A)
	1. Flight controls positioned for wind.
	2. Follow noise abatement procedures.
	3. Rotate at V<sub>r</sub>.
	4. Establish V<sub>Y</sub> and maintain &plusmn;5kts to safe altitude.
	5. Use proper wind-drift correction throughout.
2. Normal Approach and Landing (IV.B)
	1. Stabilized approach at POH recommended approach speed &plusmn;5kts (with gust factor).
	2. Use proper wind-drift correction throughout.
	3. **&star;** Touch down at a proper pitch attitude, within 200 feet beyond or on the specified point, with no side drift, and with the airplaneâ€™s longitudinal axis aligned with and over the runway center/landing path. (Go-arounds allowed.)
3. Soft-Field Takeoff and Climb (IV.C)
	1. Use proper wind-drift correction throughout.
	2. Follow noise abatement procedures.
	3. Clear the area, maintain necessary flight control inputs, taxi into takeoff position and align the airplane on the runway centerline **without stopping, while advancing the throttle smoothly to takeoff power**.
	4. Establish and maintain a pitch attitude that will transfer the weight of the airplane from the wheels to the wings as rapidly as possible.
	5. Lift off at the lowest possible airspeed and remain in ground effect while accelerating to V<sub>Y</sub> (or maybe V<sub>X</sub>).
	6. Establish V<sub>Y</sub> and maintain &plusmn;5kts to safe altitude.
4. Soft-Field Approach and Landing (IV.D)
	1. Same as Normal Landing, but **keep the nose wheel off the surface until loss of elevator effectiveness**.
	2. In addition to Normal Landing standards, **touch down with minimum sink rate**. (Go-arounds allowed.)
	3. Keep elevator back and continue movement until off "soft" area.
	4. Use proper wind-drift correction throughout.
5. Short-Field Takeoff and Maximum Performance Climb (IV.E)
	1. Flight controls positioned for wind.
	2. Follow noise abatement procedures.
	3. Taxi into takeoff position to utilize maximum available takeoff area.
	4. Hold breaks and bring full power.
	5. Rotate at V<sub>r</sub>.
	6. Establish V<sub>X</sub> and maintain &plusmn;5kts to 50 ft above surface.
	7. Establish V<sub>Y</sub> and maintain &plusmn;5kts to safe altitude.
