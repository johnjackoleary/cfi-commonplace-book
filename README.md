### Make a Note of an Issue Without Making the Change
You can [submit issues on GitHub](https://github.com/johnjackoleary/cfi-commonplace-book/issues), and they'll show up similar to [this example](https://github.com/johnjackoleary/cfi-commonplace-book/issues/10).

Suggestions can be big or small, any observations or input are helpful!

### Editing Project Files
#### If You Haven't Used Git Before
##### Editing On Your Computer
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Clone the repository wherever GitHub desktop suggests
3. Open the top level folder with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

##### Editing Directly Online
1. Click on the file you'd like to edit in GitHub, and click the edit (pencil) button.
2. Next, 'propose' your changes. Feel free to change the message and description to explain the change and update the branch name. Or don't change anything, that's also fine :)
3. Finally, open a 'pull request' to show that the changes are ready to be reviewed and merged. You can see an example of this [here](https://github.com/johnjackoleary/cfi-commonplace-book/pull/9).

#### If You Have Used Git Before
There's a few branch protections in place and specific merge strategies. Generally, you should be good to go however you prefer to approach it.

## Project Details
### Structure
- Files starting with "~ " are meant to show up on top of the list, likely they are MOCs or overviews. 
- Files starting with "+ " are aggregator files, which have no custom content but pull information about the files using Dataview or the template in [[Update Publish Files]].
- Directories:
	- Filed: Published information. Should be clean enough to be useful, with *todo* tags indicated in any areas yet to tackle.
	- Lesson Plans: Ways of teaching key concepts. Should pull mostly from cards in Filed.
	- Media: **Small** images to help build out important filed information.

### Formating
- Tags
	- with multiple words should use a hyphen ('my-awesome-tag')
	- currently there are no nested tags ('my/awesome-tag'), although Obsidian has nice support for these, so may be a consideration later
- #todo:: standardize when to use which headings levels, maybe. Or just live with it? Variety is the spice of life...
- Blocks of Learning Sizes #todo :: Helpful info, seems not worth having on top readme though
	- 400px x 400px for cards
	- somethingx440px for labels
	- 80px between rows
	- 160 between columns
	- 20 between side edge of groups, 40 between top edge of groups

### Obsidian Plug-ins Used
All plugins are meant to be optional, although Dataview is heavily used.
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) is used heavily for aggregating files and reformatting raw data. Most unusual symbols in the Markdown, especially in files like Gait Charts (e.g. [[C152 Gait]]), are for Dataview.
	- #todo :: This is difficult for publishing, because Dataview doesn't work with publish. May need to pivot further away from Dataview, for now the publishing process includes generating some Dataview tables from queries in [[Update Publish Files]].
- [Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) is for convenience in editing tables. This is totally optional but very helpful.
- [Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) for easy vault backups. 
- [Text Format](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-text-format) convenience for formatting with keyboard shortcuts.
- [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) for Obsidian Publish to work with Dataview (see article [here](https://joschua.io/posts/2023/09/01/obsidian-publish-dataview/))
- (Disabled) [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) for creating flashcards to study. This was useful for checkride prep, and could be revisited. Only disabled because it was no longer used.
