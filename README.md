## CFI Commonplace Book
One of my favorite parts of aviation is the community it brings together. This collection of index cards is meant to empower others in the community to contribute ideas, resources, etc for their own flying. I'll also use it to teach students and hope that students will contribute their own insights as they learn.

My hope is you find my CFI commonplace book useful as a starting point for your own, or that you contribute your own learnings back.

This is fundamentally a way for me to have dialogue with students and the community to improve my teaching over time.


## Structure
- Files starting with "~ " are meant to show up on top of the list, likely they are MOCs or overviews. 
- Files starting wtih "+ " are aggregator files, which have no custom content but pull information about the files using dataview.

## Obsidian Plug-ins Used
All plugins are meant to be optional, although Dataview is heavily used.
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) is used heavily for aggregating files and reformatting raw data. Most unusual symbols in the Markdown, especially in files like Gait Charts (e.g. [[C152 GAIT and Datasheet]]), are for Dataview.
- [Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) is for convenience in editing tables. This is totally optional but very helpful.


## Odds and Ends Todo
#todo :: Find and create links that are not yet created, for instance in [[Stall Speed]]
#todo :: Add more info about slip-boxes and how to contribute to this
#todo :: Consider adding something to lessons about resources and how to find good info online (maybe value of joining AOPA)
#todo :: Find way to release versions of commonplace-book
#todo :: See about none-Dataview ways for aggregating and pulling data between files (hopefully more obsidian native)
#todo :: Decide if Source folder is actually valuable (why not just have them in Filed and tagged with an aggregation top level file)
