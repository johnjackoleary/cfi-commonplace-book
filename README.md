# CFI Commonplace Book

![[~ Start Here]]

## Project Details
### Structure
- Files starting with "~ " are meant to show up on top of the list, likely they are MOCs or overviews. 
- Files starting with "+ " are aggregator files, which have no custom content but pull information about the files using Dataview or the template in [[Update Publish Files]].
- Directories:
	- Filed: Published information. Should be clean enough to be useful, with *todo* indicated in any areas yet to tackle.
	- Lesson Plans: Ways of teaching key concepts. Should pull mostly from cards in Filed.
	- Media: **Small** images to help build out important filed information.

### Obsidian Plug-ins Used
All plugins are meant to be optional, although Dataview is heavily used.
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) is used heavily for aggregating files and reformatting raw data. Most unusual symbols in the Markdown, especially in files like Gait Charts (e.g. [[C152 GAIT and Datasheet]]), are for Dataview.
	- #todo :: This is difficult for publishing, because Dataview doesn't work with publish. May need to pivot further away from Dataview, for now the publishing process includes generating some Dataview tables from queries in [[Update Publish Files]].
- [Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) is for convenience in editing tables. This is totally optional but very helpful.
- [Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) for easy vault backups. 
	- #todo :: Figure out better Git approach for allowing folks to contribute
- [Text Format](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-text-format) convenience for  formatting with keyboard shortcuts.
- [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) for Obsidian Publish to work with Dataview (see article [here](https://joschua.io/posts/2023/09/01/obsidian-publish-dataview/))
- (Disabled) [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) for creating flashcards to study. This was useful for checkride prep, and could be revisited. Only disabled because it was no longer used.
