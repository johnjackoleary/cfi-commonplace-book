```dataview
TABLE todo as "Todo" FROM #todo AND !"Templates"
```

## Odds and Ends Todo
#todo :: Find and create links that are not yet created, for instance in [[Stall Speed]]
#todo :: Consider adding something to lessons about resources and how to find good info online (maybe value of joining AOPA)
#todo :: Find way to release versions of commonplace-book
#todo :: See about non-Dataview ways for aggregating and pulling data between files (hopefully more obsidian native)
#todo :: Decide if Source folder is actually valuable (why not just have them in Filed and tagged with an aggregation top level file)
#todo :: Consider publishing with [Obisidan Sync](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Sync/Introduction+to+Obsidian+Sync) or free alternative
