### Lesson Elements

#### Definitions of Human Behavior

The study of human behavior is an attempt to explain **how & why humans function the way they do**.

1. Scientific view: it is seen as the product of factors that cause people to act in predictable ways.
   > [!example]
   > People react to the fear of speaking in public differently: avoiding or taking a class to cope with it is a product of individual experiences.
2. Satisfying needs: simple needs (food, water) v.s. complex needs (respect and acceptance)
   > [!example]
   > Some students are motivated by their passion for aviation vs some seeking social media fame.
3. Life course: Learner's age can impact how to instruct them as one's behavior changes as one matures (dependency to self-direction).
4. Personality Types: The popular MBTI test helps differentiate people's style.

#### Instructor & Learner Relationship
1. Understanding of what drives your student helps you gives better, customized instructions.
2. While you cannot change your preferred style of teaching to match every student, you can take active steps to bridge the differences.

#### [[Motivation]]
1. It is also probably the dominant force that governs the learner's progress and ability to understand. *Therefore, you should use it to your advantage.*
2. Negative Motivation
	1. *It is characteristically NOT as effective in promoting efficient learning.*
	2. It should be avoided with all but the most overconfident and impulsive learners.
3. Positive Motivation
	1. The promise of achievement of rewards: personal or social, could be financial gain, satisfaction of the self-concept, public recognition, etc.
	2. Examples: Secure, pleasant conditions, a safe environment. Tangible returns for efforts. Group approval. Belonging to a group. Favorable self-image.
4. Maintaining Motivation
	1. Source of Motivation
		1. It can be sourced from learners by understanding their background "Why are you taking this course?", "Have you ever flown a small airplane?", etc.
			1. Some has fundamental interest in aviation and just love flying
			2. Some see aviation as an opportunity to develop technical, physical, communication, problem-solving abilities.
			3. Some see this as a way to boost their ego.
			4. Some are following a family's footstep or promising career.
			5. > [!caution] 
			   > Sometimes a learner is being pressured into flight lessons, typically from a parent. It can be very difficult to work with students who are not self-motivated.
		2. *They all offer some type of reward in exchange for the hard work.*
	2. Rewarding Success
		1. Provide frequent and on-the-moment positive feedback during training
		2. Relating their accomplishments to lesson objectives
		3. Commenting favorably on their progress and level ability[^2]
	3. Presenting New Challenges
		1. *When the learner can perform a skill consistently to ACS / PTS requirements*, we should challenge them to continue to improve it so it can be demonstrated under pressure or when distracted.
		2. You can also add-on new problems or situations to challenge the student.
	4. Drops in Motivation
		1. *It is natural for motivation to wane after the initial excitement wear off*, especially after major training events such as solo, phase checks or practice tests.
		2. Learners might come unprepared or give out the vibe that aviation is no longer a priority.
		3. It is often helpful to remind them *their own stated goals* for seeking aviation training.
		4. Learning plateaus are a common source of frustration, discouragement — They should be encouraged to continue to work hard and be reassured that *it will pass and that the results will follow.*
> [!tip]
> It can be easy to forget the fun of aviation when the learner is in the middle of the learning plateau. Take a break in training and go up with the student for a $100 burger or a Bay Tour can also be an effective way to rekindle that passion.

#### [[Human Needs]]

#### [[Defense Mechanisms]]
See linked page

#### Learner Emotional Reactions
1. **Anxiety**: a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something that is going to happen ...
	1. Probably the most significant psychological factor for flight instruction as flying potentially threatening experience for people who do not have experience in flying
	2. Can be minimized by emphasizing the benefits and pleasurable experience of flying rather than citing the unhappy consequences of unsatisfactory performances
	3. > [!example]
	   > The first few landing is probably the most scary experience most people would have: pointing the nose at the ground only to "rescue" it at the last second, quiet counter-intuitive.
	   > It is important that you've demonstrated good, stable landings before they try to ease their anxiety into it.
2. **Impatience**: Failure consider the need of preliminary training and seeks the ultimate objective
	1. Often manifest in eager to make early solo, XC flights, etc.
	2. Instructor should present the necessary preliminary training for the goal with clear goals for each step [^1]
		1. This can also manifest as a mismatch of pace: Slow pace applied to a fast, motivated learner
3. **Worry or Lack of Interest**: Learners concerns about their progress in the training; personal problems, dislike of training program, instructor or even completely unrelated reasons
	1. The instructor can adapt by diverting their attention from the worries and focus on the task at hand.
	2. ... but more importantly, the instructor should prevent it by making sure learners understand exactly where they are in the process, how well they progress and their deficiencies.
4. **Physical Discomfort, Illness, Fatigue, and Dehydration**
	1. Airsickness: No sure cure; but tolerance might be built up over time. Instruction should stop when it manifests.
	2. Fatigue: one of the most treacherous hazards to flight safety — it may not be apparent until a serious mistake is made
		1. Acute fatigue: Normal occurrence of everyday living
		2. Chronic fatigue: Combination of both physiological problems and psychological issues (ex. financial, home life, job stress, etc.)
		3. If detected, a break in instruction and practice should be given or pacing should be adjusted.
	3. Dehydration: Critical loss of water from body. It reduce a pilot's level of alertness. *Be alert in hot summer days and high altitude. Carry water on every flight.*
	4. Heatstroke: Inability of the body to control its temperature
5. **Apathy Due to Inadequate Instruction**
	1. Instructor needs to provide well-planned, appropriate and accurate instruction and adjusted to the learner's level
	2. *Once the instructor loses learner confidence, it is difficult to regain.*
6. **Stress**
	1. Normal Reaction
		1. Respond rapidly and exactly, within their limits of experience and training.
		2. This is desirable to a certain degree as one tend to think rationally and act rapidly (but relies on automatic response for many responses.)
	2. Abnormal Reaction
		1. Some response can be absent, inadequate, random or illogical.
		2. Inappropriate reactions: eg. extreme over-cooperation, painstaking self-control, inappropriate laughing or singing and very rapid change in emotions
		3. *In a serious situation, instructors might need to carefully examine learners' response and their own response towards learners as it may leads to the following section ...*
7. **Seriously Abnormal Learners**
	1. If the instructor believes the learner is suffering from a serious psychological abnormality:
		1. Get a third-party instructor to conduct an evaluation flight and two instructors should confer to see if they agree further investigation is warranted
		2. Legal responsibility: If the learner have serious psychological abnormality, solo flight endorsement / practice test recommendation should be withheld.
	2. Reference [[5 Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes|Hazardous Attitudes]] for some examples
