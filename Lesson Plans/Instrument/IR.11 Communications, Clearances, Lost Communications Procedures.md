### Objective
Learn proper IFR communications techniques, include copying clearances, normal communications, and lost communication procedures 

### References
Appendix A, AIM Ch 6-4; FAR 91.185 (lost communications), IFH Appendix A (clearance shorthand)

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
Ground 2 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Communications
	1. Priorities: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate 
	2. Required position reports (MARVELOUS VFR C500) - (AIM 5-3-3)
		1. Missed approach
		2. Airspeed changes more than 10 knots or 5 percent
		3. Reaching a holding fix
		4. VFR-on-top altitude change
		5. ETA change more than 3 minutes (no radar)
		6. Leaving a holding fix
		7. Outer marker inbound (no radar)
		8. Unforecast weather
		9. Safety of flight issues
		10. Vacating an altitude
		11. Final approach fix inbound (no radar)
		12. Radio or nav failures
		13. Compulsory reporting points (no radar)
		14. 500 FPM climb or descent unable. 
	3. Position report structure (PTATEN mnemonic) (AIM 5-3-2(d))
		1. Position
		2. Time
		3. Altitude
		4. Type of flight plan (only required for reports to FSS…not to center or approach)
		5. Estimated time of arrival at the next reporting point
		6. Name of the reporting point after that
2. Clearances 
	1. When are clearances required? 14CFR 91.173
	2. How to obtain clearance
		1. Clearance Delivery/GND at Towered Airport
		2. FSS
		3. Approach/Departure Radio OR Phone
	3. CRAFT mnemonic 
		1. Clearance limit 
		2. Route 
		3. Altitude 
		4. Frequency 
		5. Transponder code 
	4. Clearance shorthand (IFH Appendix A)
	5. “At Pilots Discretion” (AIM 4-4-10)
	6. VFR on top (AIM 4-4-8)
	7. Departure Restrictions (AIM 5-2-7)
		1. Clearance void time (don’t exceed 30min)
		2. Hold for release 
		3. Release Time
		4. EDCT (depart no earlier than 5 min before and no later than 5 min after)
	8. What if I don’t like the clearance? (AIM 4-4-4)
3. Requesting Practice Approaches under VFR
	1. Request with Approach Controller
		1. Type of practice approach
		2. Own navigation or ATC Vectors?
		3. How will the approach terminate?
	2. N81034 requesting the ILS 31 practice approach into Salinas, own navigation, followed by the published missed
	3. N5286C requesting the ILS 29R practice approach into Stockton, radar vectors, full stop landing
