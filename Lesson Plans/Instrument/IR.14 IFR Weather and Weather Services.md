### Objective
Develop satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with obtaining, understanding, and applying weather information for a flight under IFR. 

### Resources
- [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
- [[Risk Management Handbook]]
- [[Instrument ACS]] Section 1.B

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[IR.7 Airspace, Charts, Flight Planning and Enroute Operations]]
- [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Meteorology for IFR flight planning 
	1. Weather system formation, including air masses and fronts 
	2. Cloud types and hazards 
	3. Turbulence 
	4. Thunderstorms and microbursts 
	5. Fog 
	6. Type and hazards of icing, including frost, conditions conducive to icing 
	7. Wind 
	8. Moisture and precipitation 
3. Current and forecast weather for departure, enroute, and arrival
	1. Sources of weather information 
	2. Weather briefing and contents 
	3. Graphical weather products 
	4. Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs, e.g. Foreflight, Garmin Pilot) 
4. Enroute weather Services 
	1. Onboard weather information 
	2. Inflight [[FSS]] weather 
5. Hazardous Inflight Weather
	1. Turbulence
	2. Thunderstorms / Hail
	3. [[Ice Hazards and Aircraft Icing]] - Tailplane stall, roll upset stall, freezing rain, [[SLD]]
6. Anti-ice/deicing and weather detection equipment and their operating characteristics to includeâ€”
	1. Airframe and/or induction Icing
		1. De-ice: rubber boots, weeping wings
		2. Anti-Ice: thermal (bleed air), electro thermal, weeping wings, propeller anti-ice
	2. air intake: carb heat, alternate intake (often connected to carb heat, but can be automatically vacuum activated)
	3. fuel system: carb heat
	4. pitot-static system: pitot heat, alternate static source
	5. radar/lightning detection system: FIS-B provides as one source, or a stormscope
	6. other inflight weather systems
		1. [[FIS-B]] 
		2. Onboard radar
		3. Sirius XM
7. Other Weather risks for IFR flight 
	1. Limitations of forecasts and inflight weather resources 
	2. How to identify alternates, when to divert to alternate 
	3. Establishing [[Personal Minimums]]

### Completion Standards
The learner must demonstrate the ability to use weather resources to obtain a weather briefing, make a competent go/no-go decision, determine if an alternate is required, ensure the alternate meets regulatory requirements, and obtain weather updates during flight.
