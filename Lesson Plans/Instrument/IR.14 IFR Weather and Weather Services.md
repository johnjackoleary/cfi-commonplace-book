### Objective
Develop satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with obtaining, understanding, and applying weather information for a flight under IFR. 

### Resources
- [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
- [[Risk Management Handbook]]
- [[Instrument ACS]] Section 1.B

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[IR.7 Airspace, Charts, Flight Planning and Enroute Operations]]
- [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Meteorology for IFR flight planning 
	1. Weather system formation, including [[air mass]]es and [[front]]s 
	2. Cloud types and hazards 
	3. [[Turbulence]] 
	4. [[Thunderstorm]]s and [[Wind Shear#Microbursts|microbursts]] 
	5. [[Fog]]
	6. Ice hazards, [[Aircraft Icing]], including frost, conditions conducive to icing
	7. Wind 
	8. Moisture and precipitation 
	9. [[Area Forecast Discussion]]
2. Current and forecast weather for departure, enroute, and arrival
	1. Sources of weather information 
	2. Weather briefing and contents ([[All Available Information Concerning That Flight]])
	3. [[Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories]]
	4. Graphical weather products 
	5. Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs, e.g. Foreflight, Garmin Pilot) 
3. Enroute weather Services 
	1. Onboard weather information 
	2. Inflight [[FSS]] weather 
4. Hazardous Inflight Weather
	1. Turbulence
	2. Thunderstorms / Hail
	3. [[Ice Hazards and Aircraft Icing]] - Stalls, tailplane stall, roll upset stall, [[Freezing Rain]], [[SLD]]

	4. What to do if any of these are encountered or forecast
5. Anti-ice/deicing and weather detection equipment and their operating characteristics to include—
	1. Airframe and/or induction Icing
		1. De-ice: rubber boots, weeping wings
		2. Anti-Ice: thermal (bleed air), electro thermal, weeping wings, propeller anti-ice
	2. air intake: carb heat, alternate intake (often connected to carb heat, but can be automatically vacuum activated)
	3. fuel system: carb heat
	4. pitot-static system: pitot heat, alternate static source
	5. radar/lightning detection system: FIS-B provides as one source, or a stormscope
	6. other inflight weather systems
		1. [[FIS-B]] 
		2. Onboard radar
		3. Sirius XM
6. Other Weather risks for IFR flight 
	1. Limitations of forecasts and inflight weather resources^[[Accident Case Study: Time Lapse – misunderstanding in-cockpit weather displays can lead to tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uvKWJS2os) from [[Air Safety Institute]]]
	2. How to identify alternates, when to divert to alternate 
	3. Establishing [[Personal Minimums]]

### Completion Standards
The learner must demonstrate the ability to use weather resources to obtain a weather briefing, make a competent go/no-go decision, and obtain weather updates during flight. 

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Procurement and use of aviation weather reports and forecasts and the elements of forecasting weather trends based on that information and personal observation of weather conditions
- Recognition of critical weather situations and windshear avoidance
