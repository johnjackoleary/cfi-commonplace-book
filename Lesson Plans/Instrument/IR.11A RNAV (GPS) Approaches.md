### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying [[RNAV]] (GPS) approaches, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures. 

### Resources
- [[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]]
- POH/AFM
- GPS manual 
- [Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Approaches (APCH)](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/RNAV_QFSheet.pdf)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[IR.5B GPS Navigation]]
- [[IR.10 Approach Charts and Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 30m, Sim/airplane â€“ 2.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements

1. GPS Receiver Types
	1. Non-[[WAAS]]: TSO-C129 or TSO C-196
	2. WAAS: TSO C-145 or TSO C-146
2. Types of [[RNAV]] (GPS) Approaches and Minima (see [[AIM 5]]-4-5(m))
	1. Some types offer lateral guidance only, and terminate at an [[MDA]]
	2. Other types offer lateral and vertical guidance (a glideslope) and terminate at a [[DA]]
	3. Some types make use of [[WAAS]] for higher accuracy
	4. Some GPS units add an advisory glideslope to lateral-only approaches, under the names LNAV+V and LP+V. These acronyms will not appear on approach charts; they only appear in the GPS system, to assist with flying LNAV and LP approaches.
	5. Other RNAV approaches that are not common in GA: [[GLS]], [[RNP]]

Ordered roughly from most accurate to least accurate:

| Abbreviation | Full Name                                    | Minimums | Requires WAAS | Notes                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[LPV]]      | Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance | [[DA]]   | Yes           | Similar performance to an ILS                                  |
| LNAV/VNAV    | LNAV/VNAV                                    | [[DA]]   | No            | Uncommon in General Aviation; requires approach-approved barometric VNAV |
| [[LP]]       | Localizer Performance                        | [[MDA]]  | Yes           |                                                                |
| [[LNAV]]     | Lateral Navigation                           | [[MDA]]  | No            |                                                                |
| Circling     |                                              | [[MDA]]  | No            | Allows the pilot to approach an airport from one direction and then circle to land on a different runway                                                               |

3. Other elements of a GPS approach
	1. Fly Over vs. Fly By Waypoints
4. [[CDI]] Sensitivity: [[RNP Precision per Approach Segment.jpeg]]
	1. Localizer-like precision^[[What's The Difference Between LPV and LNAV/VNAV Approaches?](https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/navigation/what-is-the-difference-between-lpv-and-lnav-vnav-and-plus-v-gps-approaches/) from [[Bold Method]]]
5. RNAV (GPS) Approach Shapes
	1. Basic T Shape -- [KHYR RNAV 21](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=05411R21.PDF)
	2. [[TAA]] -- [KSCK RNAV 29R](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=00407R29R.PDF) with a T, or [KLVN RNAV 12](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=06652R12.PDF) without a T
6. GPS Failures
	1.  **W** at [C83 RNAV 30](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=09141R30.PDF)
7. Bugging an [[MDA]] for [[ACS]] standards -- consider setting it +50' since standards are -0/+100
	
### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at understanding the different types of RNAV (GPS) approaches, different landing minimums, and basic shapes of RNAV (GPS) approaches. Student should be introduced to RNAV (GPS) approaches by flying multiple approaches in an approved simulator.
