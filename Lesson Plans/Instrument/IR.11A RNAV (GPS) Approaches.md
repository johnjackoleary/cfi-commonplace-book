### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying [[RNAV]] (GPS) approaches, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures. 

### Resources
- [[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]]
- POH/AFM
- GPS manual 
- [Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Approaches (APCH)](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/RNAV_QFSheet.pdf)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[IR.5B GPS Navigation]]
- [[IR.10 Approach Charts and Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 30m, Sim/airplane â€“ 2.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements

1. GPS Receiver Types
	1. Non-[[WAAS]]: TSO-C129 or TSO C-196
	2. WAAS: TSO C-145 or TSO C-146
2. Types of [[RNAV]] (GPS) Approaches
	1. Lateral Guidance Only ([[MDA]]): [[LNAV]], [[LP]]
	2. Lateral and Vertical Guidance ([[DA]]): LNAV/VNAV, [[LPV]]
	3. Lateral and Advisory Vertical Guidance: LNAV+V, LP+V
	4. Other RNAV approaches: [[GLS]], [[RNP]]
3. Other elements of a GPS approach
	1. Fly Over vs. Fly By
4. [[CDI]] Sensitivity: [[RNP Precision per Approach Segment.jpeg]]
	1. Localizer-like precision^[[What's The Difference Between LPV and LNAV/VNAV Approaches?](https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/navigation/what-is-the-difference-between-lpv-and-lnav-vnav-and-plus-v-gps-approaches/) from [[Bold Method]]]
5. RNAV (GPS) Approach Shapes
	1. Basic T Shape -- [KHYR RNAV 21](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=05411R21.PDF)
	2. [[TAA]] -- [KSCK RNAV 29R](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=00407R29R.PDF) with a T, or [KLVN RNAV 12](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=06652R12.PDF) without a T
		1. Right TAA?
6. GPS Failures
	1.  **W** at [C83 RNAV 30](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=09141R30.PDF)
7. Bugging an [[MDA]] for [[ACS]] standards -- consider setting it +50' since standards are -0/+100
	
### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at understanding the different types of RNAV (GPS) approaches, different landing minimums, and basic shapes of RNAV (GPS) approaches. Student should be introduced to RNAV (GPS) approaches by flying multiple approaches in an approved simulator.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Instrument approach procedures
