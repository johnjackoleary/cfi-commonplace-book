### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying LOC and ILS approaches, procedure turns, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures.

### Resources
- [[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]]
- POH/AFM

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[IR.5A Ground-Based Navigation]]
[[IR.10 Approach Charts and Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 30m, simulator – 2.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements

1. [[ILS]] Components
	1. Localizer
	2. Glideslope
	3. Outer Marker
		1. OM substitutions: Compass locator, PAR, ASR, DME, VOR, NDB, RNAV in conjunction with fix
		2. IM (used for CAT II and CAT III approaches)
	4. Runway Environment
2. Procedure Turns
	1. > [!quote] From [[AIM 5]]-4
	> Headings are provided for course reversal using the 45 degree type procedure turn. However, the point at which the turn may be commenced and the type and rate of turn is left to the discretion of the pilot (limited by the charted remain within xx NM distance). Some of the options are the 45 degree procedure turn, the racetrack pattern, the teardrop procedure turn, or the 80 degree ↔ 260 degree course reversal.
	2. "Cleared Straight In" vs just "Cleared"
3. When to switch to [[VLOC]] if using GPS
4. When are you established on the LOC
5. When should you intercept the glideslope?^[Thoughtful analysis in [[Watch Your Step(Down)]] and [[When to Descend on a Precision Approach - How to Fly an ILS Approach]]]
	1. Intercepting early doesn't guarantee we'll cross points before the FAF correctly (e.g. in warmer than standard temperatures) - [[InFO 11009]]
6. Other Types of Approaches
	1. [[LDA]]
	2.  Back Course
7. Errors
	1. Intercepting the GS from above increases both the possibility of a non-stabilized approach and the risk of capturing a false GS. - [[IFH]] addendum to be added to Ch9
	2. From [[Max Trescott]]'s [podcast](https://aviationnewstalk.libsyn.com/383-why-your-rnav-glide-path-wont-captureand-how-to-fix-it-ga-news), step down leading up to FAF on an LPV

### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at understanding ILS approaches and brief an ILS approach plate. Student should be introduced to ILS approaches by flying multiple approaches in an approved simulator

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Instrument approach procedures
