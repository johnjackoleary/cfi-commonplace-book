### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying LOC and ILS approaches, procedure turns, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures.

### Resources
- [[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]]
- POH/AFM

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[IR.5A VOR Navigation]]
[[IR.10 Approach Charts and Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 30m, simulator – 2.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements

1. ILS Components
	1. Localizer
	2. Glideslope
	3. Outer Marker
		1. OM substitutions: Compass locator, PAR, ASR, DME, VOR, NDB, RNAV in conjunction with fix
		2. IM (used for CAT II and CAT III approaches)
2. Procedure Turns
	1. > [!quote] From [[AIM 5]]-4
	> Headings are provided for course reversal using the 45 degree type procedure turn. However, the point at which the turn may be commenced and the type and rate of turn is left to the discretion of the pilot (limited by the charted remain within xx NM distance). Some of the options are the 45 degree procedure turn, the racetrack pattern, the teardrop procedure turn, or the 80 degree ↔ 260 degree course reversal.
4. Other Types of Approaches
	1. LDA
	2.  Back Course
5. Errors
	1. Intercepting the GS from above increases both the possibility of a non-stabilized approach and the risk of capturing a false GS. - [[IFH]] addendum to be added to Ch9

### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at understanding ILS approaches and brief an ILS approach plate. Student should be introduced to ILS approaches by flying multiple approaches in an approved simulator
