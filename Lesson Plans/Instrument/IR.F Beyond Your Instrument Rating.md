# Keeping Proficient with WINGS
By completing your instrument checkride, you can claim WINGS credit for all advanced flight and knowledge credits, and many of the basic level credits. See [[WINGS.IR Initial Certification - Instrument Rating]] for more information on this.

The WINGS program is a great way to keep proficient as a pilot. You can learn more about the program in [[WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program|WINGS]], [[WINGS.B Requirements]], or on [their website](https://www.faasafety.gov/WINGS/pub/learn_more.aspx).
