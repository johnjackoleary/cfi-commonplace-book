### Objective
To learn proper IFR communications techniques, include copying clearances, normal communications, and lost communication procedures 

### References
Appendix A, AIM Ch 6-4; FAR 91.185 (lost communications), IFH Appendix A (clearance shorthand)

### Builds On

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Communications
	1. Priorities: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate 
	2. Required position reports (MARVELOUS VFR C500) - (AIM 5-3-3)
		1. Missed approach
		2. Airspeed changes more than 10 knots or 5 percent
		3. Reaching a holding fix
		4. VFR-on-top altitude change
		5. ETA change more than 3 minutes (no radar)
		6. Leaving a holding fix
		7. Outer marker inbound (no radar)
		8. Unforecast weather
		9. Safety of flight issues
		10. Vacating an altitude
		11. Final approach fix inbound (no radar)
		12. Radio or nav failures
		13. Compulsory reporting points (no radar)
		14. 500 FPM climb or descent unable. 
	3. Position report structure (PTATEN mnemonic) (AIM 5-3-2(d))
		1. Position
		2. Time
		3. Altitude
		4. Type of flight plan (only required for reports to FSS…not to center or approach)
		5. Estimated time of arrival at the next reporting point
		6. Name of the reporting point after that
2. Clearances 
	1. CRAFT mnemonic 
		1. Clearance limit 
		2. Route 
		3. Altitude 
		4. Frequency 
		5. Transponder code 
	2. Clearance shorthand (IFH Appendix A)
	3. “At Pilots Discretion” (AIM 4-4-10)
	4. VFR on top (AIM 4-4-8)
	5. Departure Restrictions (AIM 5-2-7)
		1. Clearance void time (don’t exceed 30min)
		2. Hold for release 
		3. Release Time
		4. EDCT (depart no earlier than 5 min before and no later than 5 min after)
	6. What if I don’t like the clearance? (AIM 4-4-4)
3. Loss of Communications (91.185)
	1. Squawk 7600 
	2. In VMC, continue VFR, land as soon as practicable. 
	3. In IMC: 
		1. For Route, use mnemonic AVE-F – Assigned, Vectored, Expected, then Filed (in that order of priority) 
		2. For Altitude on each route segment, use highest of mnemonic MEA – Minimum (MEA), Expected, Assigned 
		3. Leave Clearance Limit
			1. When at fix from which approach begins, leave at EFC time if given, otherwise commence descent as close as possible to ETA
			2. When not at a fix from which approach begins, leave clearance limit at the EFC time if received and proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA. Otherwise upon arrival over the clearance limit, proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA




  

### Completion Standards
The student must become proficient at typical IFR communications using standard phraseology and demonstrate an understanding of lost communication procedures. Student must comply with clearances within +/- 10 kts, +/- 10°s, and +/- 100 feet.
