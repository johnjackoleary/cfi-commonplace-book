### Objective
To understand and practice instrument scan procedures, instrument interpretation, common errors, and partial panel procedures in case of system failure. 

### References
- [[IFH]] Ch. 6-7
- Flight Deck Poster/Diagram

### Builds On
[[IR.1 Introduction and Instrument Systems]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour; simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Fundamentals of instrument flight: cross check, instrument interpretation, aircraft control
2. Control/Performance ([[AFH Ch6]])
	1.  Pitch + Power = Performance
	2. Control Instruments
		1. Attitude Indicator
		2. Turn Coordinator
		3. Tachometer and Manifold Pressure (set by sound, then verify)
	3. Performance Instruments
		1. Airspeed
		2. VSI
		3. Altimeter
3. Introduction to Instrument Scan (ground portion) 
	1. Instrument cross check, types of scans 
	2. 4-step scan procedure to initiate any maneuver ([[AOPA]])
		1. Set approximate attitude and power 
		2. Inverted V-scan (still music scan) to check trends 
		3. Music scan primary instruments 
		4. Rectangular scan all instruments 
	3. Instrument interpretation 
	4. Diagnosing system failures (may require partial panel)
		1. Inverted-V to detect anomalies by comparing vacuum gyro (AI) to electric gyro (TC) to pitot/static (VSI)
		2. Bank triangle (most critical): A/I, TC, Compass (H/I) 
		3. Pitch triangle: A/I, Altimeter, VSI (A/S, vacuum gauge) 
4. Attitude Instrument Flight Basics (simulator and/or airplane) 
	1. Pitch-Power-Trim sequence for climb initiate and level off, Power-Pitch-Trim for descent initiate and level off
	2. Straight and Level flight (IFH 7-2)
	3. Straight climbs and descents (IFH 7-14)
	4. Turns (IFH 7-19)
5. Common Errors: 
	1. Spatial disorientation 
	2. Distraction 
	3. Fixation or omission 
	4. While turning – do nothing else 
	5. Heavy touch, over-controlling 
	6. Improper trim control

### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate understanding of: control and performance instruments; instrument scan methods and ability to diagnose and respond to system failures. Student should become proficient in S&L flight by reference to instruments, and transitions to straight climbs, descents, and turns. (ACS standards: +/- 10 kts, +/- 10°s, +- 100 feet)
