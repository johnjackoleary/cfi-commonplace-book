### Objective
Understand and practice instrument scan procedures, instrument interpretation, common errors, and partial panel procedures in case of system failure.

### Builds On
[[IR.1 Introduction and Instrument Systems]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour; simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Fundamentals of instrument flight: cross check, instrument interpretation, aircraft control
2. Control/Performance ([[AFH Ch6]])
	1.  Pitch + Power = Performance
	2. Control Instruments
		1. Attitude Indicator
		2. Turn Coordinator
		3. Tachometer and Manifold Pressure (set by sound, then verify)
	3. Performance Instruments
		1. Airspeed
		2. [[VSI]]
		3. Altimeter
3. Introduction to Instrument Scan (ground portion) 
	1. Instrument cross check, types of scans 
	2. 4-step scan procedure to initiate any maneuver (*[4 Step Instrument Scan](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2003/october/flight-training-magazine/4-step-instrument-scan)* from [[AOPA]])
		1. Set approximate attitude and power ([[Aircraft Gait Charts]])
		2. [[Inverted V-Scan]] (using [[Music Scan]]) to check trends 
		3. [[Music Scan]] primary instruments 
		4. [[Rectangular Scan]] all instruments 
	3. Instrument interpretation
4. Attitude Instrument Flight Basics (simulator and/or airplane) 
	1. Pitch-Power-Trim sequence for climb initiate and level off, Power-Pitch-Trim for descent initiate and level off
	2. Straight and Level flight ([[IFH]] 7-2)
	3. Straight climbs and descents ([[IFH]] 7-14)
	4. Turns ([[IFH]] 7-19)
5. Common Errors: 
	1. Spatial disorientation 
	2. Distraction 
	3. Fixation or omission 
	4. While turning – do nothing else 
	5. Heavy touch, over-controlling 
	6. Improper trim control

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate understanding of: control and performance instruments; instrument scan methods and ability to diagnose and respond to system failures. Learner should become proficient in S&L flight by reference to instruments, and transitions to straight climbs, descents, and turns. (ACS standards: +/- 10 kts, +/- 10°s, +- 100 feet)
