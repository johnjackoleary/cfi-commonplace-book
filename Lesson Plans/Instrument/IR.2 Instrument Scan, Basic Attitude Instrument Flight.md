### Objective
Understand and practice instrument scan procedures, instrument interpretation, and common errors in case of system failure. 

### Resources
- Flight Deck Poster/Diagram ([Sporty's](https://www.sportys.com/cessna-172r-cockpit-poster.html) or from [[IFH]] such as [[Rectangular Scan.jpeg]])

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[IR.1 Introduction and Instrument Systems]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour; simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Fundamentals of instrument flight, in order: <u>C</u>ross check, <u>I</u>nstrument interpretation, <u>A</u>ircraft control ([[CIA|CIA]] as a memory aid)
2. Control/Performance ([[IFH]] Ch6)
	1.  Pitch + Power = Performance
	2. Control Instruments depict immediate attitude and power changes
		1. Attitude Indicator
		2. Turn Coordinator
		3. Tachometer and Manifold Pressure (set by sound, then verify)
	3. Performance Instruments reflect the performance the aircraft is achieving
		1. Airspeed
		2. Altimeter and [[VSI]]
		3. Heading
3. Introduction to Instrument Scan (ground portion) 
	1. Instrument cross check, types of scans 
	2. 4-step scan procedure to initiate any maneuver (*[4 Step Instrument Scan](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2003/october/flight-training-magazine/4-step-instrument-scan)* from [[AOPA]])
		1. Set approximate attitude and power ([[Aircraft Gait Charts]])
		2. [[Inverted V-Scan]] (using [[Music Scan]]) to check trends 
		3. [[Music Scan]] primary instruments 
		4. [[Rectangular Scan]] all instruments 
	3. Instrument interpretation
4. Attitude Instrument Flight Basics (simulator and/or airplane) 
	1. Pitch-Power-Trim sequence for climb initiate and level off, Power-Pitch-Trim for descent initiate and level off
	2. Straight and Level flight ([[IFH]] 7-2)
	3. Straight climbs and descents ([[IFH]] 7-14)
	4. Turns ([[IFH]] 7-19)
5. [[See and Avoid]] still expected [[IFR]] on [[VMC]] day
6. Common Errors: 
	1. Spatial disorientation 
	2. Distraction 
	3. Fixation or omission 
	4. While turning – do nothing else 
	5. Heavy touch, over-controlling 
	6. Improper trim control

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate understanding of: control and performance instruments; instrument scan methods. Learner should become proficient in S&L flight by reference to instruments, and transitions to straight climbs, descents, and turns. (ACS standards: +/- 10 kts, +/- 10°s, +- 100 feet)

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Preflight procedures
- Postflight procedures
- Preflight preparation
