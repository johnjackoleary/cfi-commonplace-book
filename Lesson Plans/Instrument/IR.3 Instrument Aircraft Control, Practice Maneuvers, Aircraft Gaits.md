### Objective
Further develop instrument scan procedures, and practice all phases of IFR flight, with transitions between the various maneuvers. Develop and document “gait” chart for the aircraft in use. 

### Resources
None

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[IR.2 Instrument Scan, Basic Attitude Instrument Flight]]

### Schedule
Simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Attitude Instrument Flight practice maneuvers (simulator and/or airplane)
	1. Straight and Level flight
	2. Straight climbs and descents 
	3. Turns – standard rate (IFH 7-19) and steep turns (IFH 7-22) 
	4. Constant rate climbs and descents 
	5. Combinations of turns during other maneuvers (such as “Oscar Pattern”, shown next page) 
	6. Simulated [[IFR]] flight example 
		1. Climb Vy to specific altitude, with vectoring turns 
		2. Transition to cruise climb, with vectoring turns 
		3. Level off, cruise configuration, vectoring turns 
		4. Cruise descents, vectoring turns 
		5. Level off, slow cruise, vectoring turns 
		6. Slow cruise descent, vectoring turns 
		7. Simulated MAP, climb, turn, level off, hold at fix 
		8. Timed Turns (just a demo, cover DG)
	7. [[Media/Aircraft/Aircraft Gait Charts]], Learn and make table of following values: 
		1. Make rows of table for Vx, Vy, cruise climb, cruise, cruise descent, slow cruise (holding, initial approach), slow descent (final approach)
		2. Make columns of table for pitch (# bars on A/I), Manifold Pressure, RPM, airspeed 
		3. Or use the [[Aircraft Blank Gait]]
2. Common Errors
	1. Fixation or omission
	2. Forgetting to check HSI vs compass (non-slaved systems) 
	3. Doing things while turning – should do nothing else until turn is complete 
	4. Heavy touch, over-controlling
	5. Improper trim control

### Completion Standards
Student must become proficient at transitioning between the phases of flight used on a typical IFR flight. Maintain heading within 10°, altitude within 100 feet, airspeed within 10 kts.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Flight by reference to instruments

### Required Homework
- [ ] Memorize the [[Media/Aircraft/Aircraft Gait Charts|"Gait" table]] and/or have printed on kneeboard
