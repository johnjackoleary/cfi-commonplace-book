### Lesson Elements
1. Precision vs. Non Precision
	1. Precision
		1. [[ILS]] 
		2. [[PAR]] 
		3. GPS [[LPV]] (technically not a precision approach, but included here because of similarity^[This is not a precision approach because it does not require the same equipment available to transition from IMC to VMC, namely things like the [[ALS]]. Good video on this topic from [[The Finer Points]] is viewable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1a-9KOdxQY).])
	2. Non-Precision
		1. Lateral Guidance Only
		2. Fly to a Minimum Descent Altitude
2. Approaches (Part 97)
	1. Reading plates 
	2. Approach categories: A <91 kts, B <121 kts, C <141 kts, D <166 kts, E >166 kts
	3. Parts of approach: Initial (IAF->IF), Intermediate (IF->FAF), Final (FAF->MAP), Missed (MAP->...)
3. Nav equipment considerations
	1. Use of GPS maps and guidance for initial approach ([[AC 90-108]])
	2. Methods for switching CDI from GPS to VOR/LOC 
	3. CDI sensitivity changes during approach 
	4. Missed approach guidance – how to resume GPS guidance for missed approach 
4. ATC Approach Clearances
	1. [[PTAC]] #memory-aid for an approach clearance
		1. >[!quote] 81034, you are 5 miles from UUHUT. Fly heading 220. Maintain 3100 until established on the localizer. Cleared ILS 25R approach.
		2. >[!quote] 5286C, 3 miles from SMONE. Fly direct SMONE. Cross SMONE at 4900. Cleared RNAV 25R.
		3. More examples in [Approach Clearance](https://www.ifr-magazine.com/technique/approach-clearance/) from [[IFR Magazine]]
	2. [[When Are You Established]]?
	3. Requesting Practice Approaches under VFR
		1. Request with Approach Controller
			1. Type of practice approach
			2. Own navigation or ATC Vectors?
			3. How will the approach terminate?
		2. >[!quote] 81034 requesting the ILS 31 practice approach into Salinas, own navigation, followed by the published missed
		3. >[!quote] 5286C requesting the ILS 29R practice approach into Stockton, radar vectors, full stop landing
5. [Sample Approach Profile](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/Files/AOPA/Home/Training-and-Safety/Air-Safety/ASI-BeyondPro-IFR_StableApproach_SampleProfile.pdf) from [[AOPA]]
6. Descent Profiles: 
	1. “Dive & Drive” vs [[CDFA]] (Continuous Descent Final Appr [[AC 120-108]])
		1. Great [[AOPA]] article [here](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2020/march/pilot/on-instruments-diving-and-driving)
	2. [[VDP]]
		1. When published, do not descend below MDA until past
		2. Good to calculate if not published 
			1. Take the AGL value of the MDA and divide it by 300
	3. [[MDA]]
	4. Identifying MAP
		1. Timing from FAF to MAP
		2. GPS/DME
	5. Use of flaps when near minimums^[Adding flaps when breaking out at 200' may be more destabilizing than they are worth. Consider only adding flaps if, for example, you've broken out />1000' AGL.]
	6. Using the vertical guidance beyond precision FAF, while convenient, may not keep you above the required step-down altitudes. More information [here](https://www.ifr-magazine.com/avionics/watch-your-stepdown/).
7. Airport lighting and environment
	1. What are you expecting to see based on the plate? E.g. [[REIL]], [[ALS]], [[PAPI]]
	2. Inop components impact available in [[TPP]]s
	3. Pilot controlled lights
	4. May need to ask towered airports to turn lights up (or down)
8. At DA – what is required to descend below DA or MDA? ([[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing|FAR 91.175]]) 
	1. Continuously in position to land, with normal descent rate and maneuvers 
	2. AND Flight visibility >= minimum 
	3. AND any one of:
		1. [[ALS]], although only to [[TDZE]]+100’
		2. Runway end identifier lights
		3. [[VGSI]]
		4. Threshold, threshold markings, threshold lights
		5. Runway, runway markings, runway lights
		6. Touchdown zone, touchdown zone markings, touchdown zone lights
9. When is a missed approach required? ([[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]])
	1. At [[DA]] or [[MAP]], if references above are not visible 
	2. If below MDA/DA, visibility < min OR lost view of airport references 
	3. During circling maneuver at or above MDA, airport not visible 
10. Missed approach 
	1. When to execute missed approach?
	2. Procedure: Cram, Climb, Cool, Configure, Call
	3. How to handle MA before MAP 
		1. "Fly over" MAP first (must stay on the lateral course)
		2. You can begin to climb anytime, assuming no contrary notes in the [[IAP]]
	4. How to handle "go-around" after MAP^[Example in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtlS0sxFlHk) of loosing visibility on final]
		1. May choose to cancel IFR if conditions permit
		2. In ATC environment - immediately contact ATC to obtain amended clearance
		3. If unable to contact ATC, attempt to re-intercept published segment of missed approach
11. Circle to land approaches (AIM 5-4-20)
	1. Approach chart named with letter instead of runway number OR a circling approach might be preferred if the straight in runway is not usable because of wind or other reasons
	2. Review circling minimums and notes on approach chart 
	3. Review circling approach protected areas (maneuvering radius)
		1. 1.3nm from each runway end for Category A at most altitudes
		2. Old vs new approach categories
		3. AIM 5-4-20
	4. Loss of flight visibility or airport, execute missed 
	5. Missed approach during circle-to-land procedure (AIM 5-4-21)
12. Visual and Contact approaches: 
	1. Visual approach (AIM 5-4-23) – must have airport or preceding aircraft in sight, ceiling > 1000’ AGL, vis >3 SM 
	2. Contact approach (AIM 5-4-25) – pilot must request, vis >1 SM, clear of clouds 
13. Common errors 
	1. Getting “behind” the airplane, not ready for missed approach, failing to accomplish checklist items 
	2. Overcontrolling during final phase of approach, with high CDI sensitivity 
	3. Using wrong navigation source during approach 
	4. Unstable approach, failure to configure for approach and landing 
	5. Descent below DA (slight dip is allowed)

### Completion Standards
Learner understand the information contained in an approach plate and can brief an approach. Learner can describe how various elements of an approach plate will translate to procedures in flight.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- IFR navigation and approaches by use of navigation systems
- Use of... instrument approach procedure charts
