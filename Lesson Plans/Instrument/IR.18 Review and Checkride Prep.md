### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, Flight 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Emergencies 
	1. Instrument or system failures 
	2. Partial panel, no-gyro approaches (ASR, PAR) 
	3. Lost communications review (see Appendix B). Recognizing loss of communications and attempting to re-establish. 
	4. Weather emergencies: Icing, thunderstorms 
	5. Electrical system failures, EFD or MFD failure 
	6. “Minimum fuel” vs “Fuel Emergency” 
		1. Fuel reserves are required at takeoff, it is not illegal to use part of that reserve. 
		2. Declare “Minimum fuel” when in your judgment, you can accept no undue delay. This is NOT an emergency declaration 
		3. Declare fuel emergency when in your judgment, it is necessary to proceed directly to your destination airport. ATC will give priority. 
2. Review and practice: 
	1. Review knowledge test items 
	2. ACS requirements and standards 
	3. DPs, STARs 
	4. Holding patterns and entries 
	5. Non-precision and precision approaches to ACS standards 
	6. Circle to land approaches, risks, and how to fly MAP after circling 
	7. “Devil’s triangle” approach practices (SCK/TCY/LVK or OAK/OAK/HWD, etc.) multiple approaches, missed approaches, holding patterns, etc.
	8. Practice checkride including phase check as appropriate 
	9. Logbook entries and endorsements 
	10. Aircraft prep for checkride, tab MX records, POH/AFM, etc. 
3. Video, showing DPE’s perspectives on Instrument Practical Test - Andy Munnis (specifically on oral part of exam): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUzR8f1Npss
 
### Completion Standards
The student must demonstrate proficiency at IFR flight planning and all phases of IFR flight, to ACS standards, including ability to complete no precision approach without use of primary flight instruments.
