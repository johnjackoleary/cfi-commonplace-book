### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying non-precision approaches, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures. 

### References
FAR 91.175, AIM Ch 5-4, IFH Ch 10, IPH Ch. 4, POH/AFM, GPS manual 

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, simulator and/or airplane – 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements

1. Types of approaches
	1. Traditional non-precision approaches, including ASR. These use an MDA: NDB, VOR, GPS LNAV, LOC, 
	2. APV (approach with vertical guidance), using DA: GPS LNAV/VNAV, GPS LPV, LDA + glidepath, 
2. Descent Profiles: 
	1. “Dive & Drive” vs CDFA (Continuous Descent Final Appr AC 120-108)
	2. VDP
		1. When published, do not descend below MDA until past
		2. Good to calculate if not published 
			1. Take the AGL value of the MDA and divide it by 300
	3. MDA - what is required to continue descent? 
	4. Identifying MAP
		1. Timing from FAF to MAP
		2. GPS/DME
3. GPS Specific
	1. Missed approach – how to resume guidance at MAP
4. Circle to land approaches (AIM 5-4-20)
	1. Approach chart named with letter instead of runway number OR a circling approach might be preferred if the straight in runway is not usable because of wind or other reasons
	2. Review circling minimums and notes on approach chart 
	3. Review circling approach protected areas (maneuvering radius)
		1. 1.3nm from each runway end for Category A at most altitudes
		2. Old vs new approach categories
		3. AIM 5-4-20
	4. Loss of flight visibility or airport, execute missed 
	5. Missed approach during circle-to-land procedure (AIM 5-4-21)
5. Visual and Contact approaches: 
	1. Visual approach (AIM 5-4-23) – must have airport or preceding aircraft in sight, ceiling > 1000’ AGL, vis >3 SM 
	2. Contact approach (AIM 5-4-25) – pilot must request, vis >1 SM, clear of clouds 
6. Common errors 
	1. Unstable approaches 
	2. Failure to configure aircraft for approach and landing 
	3. Failure to manage automation
	4. Descent below MDA (+100’ -0’ at MDA) 
	5. Using wrong navigation source during approach 
	6. Loss of sequencing with GPS during missed approach 
	7. Loss of situational awareness during missed approach or circling approach 
### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at flying non-precision approaches to ACS standards to landing, including circling approaches, and missed approach procedures.
