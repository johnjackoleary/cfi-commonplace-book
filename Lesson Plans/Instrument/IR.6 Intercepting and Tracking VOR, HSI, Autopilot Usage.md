### Objective
VOR orientation, course intercepts and tracking, and use of HSI, if available. DME arcs. Autopilot systems and operation. 

### References
- [[Instrument ACS]] section V
- [[IFH]] Ch 9
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]] 

### Builds On
- [[IR.3 Instrument Aircraft Control, Practice Maneuvers, Aircraft Gaits]]
- [[IR.4 Navigation Aids and Instruments]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hour; simulator and/or airplane, 2 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. [[VOR]] introduction
	1. Azimuth Information
	2. [[DME]]
	3. Service Volumes (New vs. Original)
	4. Charts 
2. VOR, OBS, CDI, To/From indicator, HSI, tuning, identification, and receiver check (logged in last 30 days) 
3. VOR orientation 
	1. Where are you relative to the station? (Center CDI with FROM) 
	2. Where are you relative to assigned course? (Parallel course, set OBS to course, CDI needle points toward the course) 
	3. Where are you relative to intersection defined by VOR radial? (Set OBS to radial, confirm FROM, if CDI needle deflected toward station, you’re not there yet. For HSI, CDI needle ahead, you’re not there yet.) 
4. VOR intercepts 
	1. Use 45° intercept heading if CDI fully deflected. 
	2. Use 20° intercept if CDI is alive. 
5. VOR course tracking 
	1. Wind correction angle – start with 20°s, at intercept, reduce to 10°s, keep reducing or increasing by half until it works. 
	2. Once tracking, use small heading adjustments (few degrees) to maintain course
6. DME arcs
	1. “Turn 10, Twist 10”
	2. Interception: Lead 90 heading perpendicular to the arc/radial by ~1 nm
	3. On the arc: Every new 10 radial, turn 10° and twist OBS 10°
		1. If inside/outside arc: heading turn may be slightly more or less than 10°
	4. Note how quickly the needle swings, and lead turn appropriately
		1. Should lead by ~1nm
		2. Consider (60 / DME distance) = degrees deflection to lead by
7. Autopilot systems and usage 
	1. POH and AFM supplements pertaining to Autopilot 
	2. Preflight check of autopilot 
	3. Autopilot usage, modes, GPS integration, altitude functions 
	4. VVM: Verbalize, Verify, Monitor
8. Common Errors 
	1. Incorrect tuning and identification procedures 
	2. Failure to set navigation selector for the course to be intercepted (GPS vs VOR/VLOC switch) 
### Completion Standards
Student must be able to tune and ID VOR navaid, detect failures; check receiver for proper operation; orient to a VOR station or course; intercept assigned course; track course to or from VOR, with crosswind correction; Maintain heading within 10°s, altitude within 100 feet, airspeed within 10 kts. Student must know how to check autopilot operation during preflight, and how to use autopilot during enroute flight.
