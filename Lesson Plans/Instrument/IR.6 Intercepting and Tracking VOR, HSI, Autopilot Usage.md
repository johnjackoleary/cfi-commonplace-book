### Objective
VOR orientation, course intercepts and tracking, and use of HSI, if available. DME arcs. Autopilot systems and operation. 

### References
- [[Instrument ACS]] section V
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]] 

### Builds On
- [[IR.3 Instrument Aircraft Control, Practice Maneuvers, Aircraft Gaits]]
- [[IR.4 Navigation Aids and Instruments]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hour; simulator and/or airplane, 2 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. [[Ground-Based Navigation using VOR, DME, and ILS]]
6. DME arcs
	1. “Turn 10, Twist 10”
	2. Interception: Lead 90 heading perpendicular to the arc/radial by ~1 nm
	3. On the arc: Every new 10 radial, turn 10° and twist OBS 10°
		1. If inside/outside arc: heading turn may be slightly more or less than 10°
	4. Note how quickly the needle swings, and lead turn appropriately
		1. Should lead by ~1nm
		2. Consider (60 / DME distance) = degrees deflection to lead by
7. Autopilot systems and usage 
	1. POH and AFM supplements pertaining to Autopilot 
	2. Preflight check of autopilot 
	3. Autopilot usage, modes, GPS integration, altitude functions 
	4. VVM: Verbalize, Verify, Monitor
8. Common Errors 
	1. Incorrect tuning and identification procedures 
	2. Failure to set navigation selector for the course to be intercepted (GPS vs VOR/VLOC switch) 
### Completion Standards
Student must be able to tune and ID VOR navaid, detect failures; check receiver for proper operation; orient to a VOR station or course; intercept assigned course; track course to or from VOR, with crosswind correction; Maintain heading within 10°s, altitude within 100 feet, airspeed within 10 kts. Student must know how to check autopilot operation during preflight, and how to use autopilot during enroute flight.
