### Objective
Develop working [[IFR]] knowledge of the airspace system, IFR charts, flight planning, and enroute operations.

### Resources
- [[Instrument ACS]] Section 1.C
- [Minimum Vectoring/Instrument Altitudes KML Files](https://cfi.thomas-daniel.com/mva/)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
None

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. [[National Airspace System]] and Regulations 
	1. Airspace classification 
	2. VFR minimums ([[Categorical Outlooks]])
	3. IFR minimums (alternates discussed later) - [[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]]
		1. Departures (standard, non-standard)
		2. Approaches - [[Operation Below Below DA or MDA]]
	4. Federal Airways
		1. 8nm width (4nm either side of course centerline)
	5. Flight Levels and switching to standard pressure ([[AIM 7]]-2)
	6. "One in/one out" rule for multiple IFR operations in Class D/E/G^[More info in [this writeup](https://laartcc.org/stm/multiple-ifr-aircraft-approaching-one-airport)]
2. Enroute Charts: Chart Userâ€™s Guide
	1. High/Low
	2. Airports, airspace
	3. Navaids
	4. Q,T,V,J Routes, [[COP]]s, mileage
	5. [[MEA]]s, [[MOCA]]s, [[OROCA]]s
	6. Off-Route Obstacle Clearance (Mountainous/Non-Mountainous)
	7. [[MVA]], [[MIA]]
	8. [[MCA]], [[MRA]]
	9. Finding airport and [[ARTCC]] frequencies 
	10. Compulsory reporting points ([[AIM 5]]-3-2)
3. Flight planning 
	1. Navigation logs, plotters, computers (E6B, etc.), wind computations 
	2. Fuel planning and requirements ([[FAR 91.167 IFR Fuel Reqs]])
	3. [[TEC]] routes
	4. Flight plan forms and filing
	5. [Equipment codes](https://support.foreflight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049193173-ICAO-Equipment-and-PBN-Code-Setup-Guide) on [[ForeFlight]]
	6. Clearance available 30min before departure time and 120min after
4. [[ATC]] system 
	1. Communication and Navigation facilities (Approach/Departure ([[TRACON]]), Center [[ARTCC]])
	2. [[Radar]] and [[transponder]]s 
	3. [[ADS-B]]
	4. [[FSS]]
5. Alternates ([[FAR 91.169 IFR Flight Plan Info Reqd]])
	1. When is one needed? ([[1-2-3 Rule]])
		1. How to get the weather forecasts at airports without a TAF
	2. Standard alternate minimums: Precision, Non Precision, no published [[IAP]]
	3. Non-standard alternate minimums
	4. Alternatives for non-[[WAAS]] GPS cannot use GPS approaches at both destination AND alternate ([[AIM 1]]-1-17)
	5. Practical advice. The best alternatives:
		1. Are in a different microclimate than your destination
		2. Have an [[ILS]], which gives you the best chance of landing in IMC
		3. Have a [[TAF]], making it easier to forecast the weather specifically at the airport
	6. Diversions while in flight vs. planned alternate

### Completion Standards
Learner must be able to plan a cross country flight, including routing, fuel planning, and filing an IFR flight plan, and receiving weather briefings (in person and online).

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Use of IFR en route... charts
