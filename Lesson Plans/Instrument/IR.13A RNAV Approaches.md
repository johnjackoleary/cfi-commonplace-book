### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying non-precision approaches, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures. 

### References
FAR 91.175, AIM Ch 5-4, IFH Ch 10, IPH Ch. 4, POH/AFM, GPS manual 

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, simulator and/or airplane – 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements

1. Types of RNAV (GPS) Approaches
	2. Lateral Guidance only
		1. LNAV, LP
	3. With Glideslope
		1. LPV, LNAV/VNAV 
	4. With Vertical Reference
		1. LNAV+V, LP+V
2. Other RNAV approaches
	1. GLS, RNP

5. GPS Specific
	1. Missed approach – how to resume guidance at MAP
6. Circle to land approaches (AIM 5-4-20)
	1. Approach chart named with letter instead of runway number OR a circling approach might be preferred if the straight in runway is not usable because of wind or other reasons
	2. Review circling minimums and notes on approach chart 
	3. Review circling approach protected areas (maneuvering radius)
		1. 1.3nm from each runway end for Category A at most altitudes
		2. Old vs new approach categories
		3. AIM 5-4-20
	4. Loss of flight visibility or airport, execute missed 
	5. Missed approach during circle-to-land procedure (AIM 5-4-21)
7. Visual and Contact approaches: 
	1. Visual approach (AIM 5-4-23) – must have airport or preceding aircraft in sight, ceiling > 1000’ AGL, vis >3 SM 
	2. Contact approach (AIM 5-4-25) – pilot must request, vis >1 SM, clear of clouds 
8. Common errors 
	1. Unstable approaches 
	2. Failure to configure aircraft for approach and landing 
	3. Failure to manage automation
	4. Descent below MDA (+100’ -0’ at MDA) 
	5. Using wrong navigation source during approach 
	6. Loss of sequencing with GPS during missed approach 
	7. Loss of situational awareness during missed approach or circling approach 
### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at flying non-precision approaches to ACS standards to landing, including circling approaches, and missed approach procedures.
