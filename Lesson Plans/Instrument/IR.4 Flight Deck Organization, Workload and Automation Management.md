### Objective
Understand the ways to utilize different tools in the flight deck, understand the benefits and risks associated with automation management, and learn techniques to efficiently manage workflows during IFR flight. 

### Resources
None

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, sim/airplane 1 hour

### Lesson Elements
#### Flight Deck Organization
1. [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]]
2. Digital Charts ([[EFB]])
	1. Pros - lighter, backlighting, digital updates, GPS integration, EFB can include more than just charts (TIS-B, Datalink weather, W+B, Chart supplements)
	2. Cons - Battery, fragile, can’t update inflight, expensive
3. Paper Charts
	1. Pros - Don’t require battery, less fragile than EFB
	2. Cons - Expire, no search function, take space and weight
4. Mounting
	1. Yoke, kneeboard, suction
5. Chart and database currency
	1. Every 56 days (8 weeks)
	2. [[FAA]] vs. Jeppesen

#### IFR Flows
1. Use of BOTH written and mental checklists 
	1. Use mental checklists and flow patterns 
	2. Double check and back-up with written checklists 
2. Mental checklists 
	1. Before takeoff: [[CIGARS]] / [[CIGAR TIP]]
	2. Before taking runway: [[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]
	4. Approach briefing at 50nm, 30nm, 10nm: [[AIRBAG]] or [[WRIMTMS]]
	5. Non-radar position reports: [[PTATEN]]
	6. At each IFR waypoint or turn: [[5 Ts]]
	7. Before final intercept: Morse (ID nav receivers, Source ([[CDI]] source^[[[1000 Dollar Button]]]), Course (confirm cdi course), Force (throttle)
	8. Before [[FAF]]: Baro Mins Set/Confirmed, Baro Altimeter Set, Alt Bug Set, Power / Config Set, [[GUMPS]], Runway Lights 7 Clicks
	9. Before landing: [[GUMPS]]
	10. Missed Approach: [[5 C's (Going Missed)]], then set up avionics for missed,
3. Common Errors 
	1. Forgetting to use mental checklists 
	2. Rushing to keep up with the plane 
	3. Diverting attention during maneuvers like turning, or before reaching altitude. 
	4. Not recognizing fatigue and task saturation

#### Autopilot Usage
![[Autopilot Systems and Usage]]

### Completion Standards
The student must demonstrate the ability to prioritize tasks during IFR flight, “stay ahead” of the airplane by using mental checklists and written checklists.
