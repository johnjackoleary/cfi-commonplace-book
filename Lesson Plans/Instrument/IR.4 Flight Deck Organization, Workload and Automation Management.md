### Objective
Understand the ways to utilize different tools in the flight deck, understand the benefits and risks associated with automation management, and learn techniques to efficiently manage workflows during IFR flight. 

### Resources
None

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, sim/airplane 1 hour

### Lesson Elements
#### Flight Deck Organization
1. [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]]
2. [[SRM]] and [[CRM]] including crew communication and coordination ([[AC 120-51]])
	1. CRM Basics
		1. Communications Processes and Decision Behavior^[Briefings, Inquiry/Advocacy/Assertion, Crew Self-Critique (Decisions and Actions), Conflict Resolution, Communications and Decisionmaking]
		2. Team Building and Maintenance
	2. [[SRM]] basics
		1. appropriate management of all resources (in and out of aircraft) available to the single pilot
		2. How can resources be organized before the flight for better [[SRM]]?
3. Digital Charts ([[EFB]])
	1. Pros - lighter, backlighting, digital updates, GPS integration, EFB can include more than just charts (TIS-B, Datalink weather, W+B, Chart supplements)
	2. Cons - Battery, fragile, can’t update inflight, expensive, over heat
4. Paper Charts
	1. Pros - Don’t require battery, less fragile than EFB
	2. Cons - Expire, no search function, take space and weight
5. Mounting
	1. Yoke^[weight on controls], kneeboard^[head motion down], suction^[obscures peripheral vision]
	2. Turbulence
6. Chart and database currency
	1. Every 56 days (8 weeks)
	2. [[FAA]] vs. [[Jeppesen]]

#### IFR Flows
1. Use of BOTH written and mental checklists 
	1. Use mental checklists and flow patterns 
	2. Double check and back-up with written checklists 
2. Mental checklists 
	1. Runup/before takeoff: [[CIGARS]] / [[CIGAR TIP]]
	2. Before taking runway: [[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]
	3. Approach briefing at 50nm, 30nm, 10nm: [[AIRBAG]] or [[WRIMTMS]]^[This is also a reasonable time to set the destination altimeter. Good writeup [here](https://www.thinkaviation.net/when-should-you-set-the-altimeter/).]
	4. Non-radar position reports: [[PTATEN]]
	5. At each IFR waypoint or turn: [[5 Ts]]
	6. Before final intercept: Morse (ID nav receivers), Source ([[CDI]] source^[[[1000 Dollar Button]]]), Course (confirm CDI course), Force (throttle)
	7. Before [[FAF]]: Baro Mins Set/Confirmed, Baro Altimeter Set, Alt Bug Set, Power / Config Set, [[GUMPS]], Runway Lights 7 Clicks
	8. Before landing: [[GUMPS]]
	9. Missed Approach: [[5 C's (Going Missed)]], then set up avionics for missed
3. [[SRM]]
	1. Verbalize flows and checklists, changes, [[VVM]], and "[[Two Most Important Things in Aviation|next two things]]"
	2. Callouts with 1000', 500', 200', 100' to be before a level off or [[DA]]
4. Common Errors 
	1. Forgetting to use mental checklists 
	2. Rushing to keep up with the plane 
	3. Diverting attention during maneuvers like turning, or before reaching altitude. 
	4. Not recognizing fatigue and task saturation

#### Autopilot Usage
![[Autopilot Systems and Usage]]

### Completion Standards
The student must demonstrate the ability to prioritize tasks during IFR flight, “stay ahead” of the airplane by using mental checklists and written checklists.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Safe and efficient operation of aircraft under instrument flight rules and conditions
- Crew resource management, including crew communication and coordination

### Required Homework
- [ ] Memorize flows above and add to kneeboard
