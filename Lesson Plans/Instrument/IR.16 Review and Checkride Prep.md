### Objective
Review emergency procedures, review knowledge test items, practice and prepare for checkride, including phase check and/or practice checkride. 

### Resources
- [Pilot Cafe Quick Review Guide](https://www.pilotscafe.com/IFR-quick-review-guide/)
- [[IFR Regulatory Review Assignment]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[~ IR Lesson Plan Outline|All Lessons]]
- [[PPL7.1 Review and Checkride Preparation]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, Flight 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. [[WVFC]] specific
	1. Instrument knowledge quiz
	2. Instrument phase check
2. Emergencies and [[ADM]]
	1. Instrument or system failures 
	2. Partial panel, no-gyro approaches (ASR, PAR) 
	3. [[Lost communications]] review (see [[IR.D Kneeboard Cheatsheets]]). Recognizing loss of communications and attempting to re-establish. 
	4. Weather emergencies: [[Ice Hazards and Aircraft Icing]], [[Thunderstorm]] 
	5. Electrical system failures, [[PFD]] or [[MFD]] failure, [[EFB]] failure
	6. "[[Minimum Fuel]]" vs "[[Emergency Fuel]]"
		1. Fuel reserves are required at takeoff, it is not illegal to use part of that reserve. 
		2. Declare "Minimum fuel" when in your judgment, you can accept no undue delay. This is NOT an emergency declaration 
		3. Declare "fuel emergency" when in your judgment, it is necessary to proceed directly to your destination airport. ATC will give priority. 
3. Review and practice
	1. Review knowledge test items 
	2. [[Instrument ACS]] requirements and standards 
		1. Also helpful to read [[ACS Tips for Evaluators]]
	3. [[DP]]s, [[STAR]]s 
	4. [[IR.8 Holding Patterns and Entries|Holding patterns and entries]] 
	5. Non-precision and precision approaches to ACS standards 
	6. Circle to land approaches, risks, and how to fly MAP after circling 
	7. "Devil’s triangle" approach practices (SCK/TCY/LVK or OAK/OAK/HWD, etc.) multiple approaches, missed approaches, holding patterns, etc.
	8. Practice checkride including phase check as appropriate 
	9. Logbook entries and endorsements 
	10. Aircraft prep for checkride, tab MX records, POH/AFM, etc.
	11. [[Human Factors]] and [[Illusions Leading to Spatial Disorientation]] for instrument flight
	12. [[IFR Regulatory Review Assignment]]
4. Video, showing DPE’s perspectives on Instrument Practical Test - Andy Munnis (specifically on oral part of exam): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUzR8f1Npss
	1. Use of checklists / resources in the oral portion^[It’s great to create a reference document to use in flight, and it is fine to reference that both in the airplane and during the oral. However, pulling out an unmodified, large document isn’t a great look. In the former case, you’re showing you’ve prepared for the scenario, and that looks great. In the latter case, you’re showing you didn’t prepare and are leaning on someone else's preparation.]
 
### Completion Standards
The student must demonstrate proficiency at IFR flight planning and all phases of IFR flight, to ACS standards, including ability to complete no precision approach without use of primary flight instruments.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Aeronautical decision making and judgment
- Appropriate information that applies to flight operations under IFR in the [[AIM]]
