### Objective
Develop understanding of IFR flight training process, and detailed knowledge of instrument systems and pre-flight checks.

> [!note]
> This lesson is designed as both an introduction to [[IFR]] training and an in-depth review of instrument systems and pre-flight likely covered in [[PPL]] training.

### Resources
- [[IR.A Instrument Rating Flight Experience Requirements]]
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]] 

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]

### Schedule
Ground 1-3 hours, depending on recall from [[PPL]]

### Lesson Elements
1. Overview of [[IFR]] flight training process, syllabus overview 
	1. Aircraft choice, high performance, traditional vs technically advanced. Time and cost commitment and scheduling 
		1. Private: 70-90 hours, about $20k-$30k
		2. Instrument 40-60 hours, about $15k-$20k
		3. Simulation software and PC tools
		4. Use of [[AATD]]/[[BATD]] and safety pilots to reduce costs
	2. [[IR.A Instrument Rating Flight Experience Requirements]]
	3. Airman Certification Standards ([[Instrument ACS]]) and Knowledge (written) test
	4. Recency of experience [[FAR 61.57 Recent Flight Experience]] and [[FAR 61.51 Pilot Logbooks]]
		1. Logging [[IAP]], what’s required  ([[InFO15012]])
		2. > [!warning] For future commercial pilots
		   > This time does NOT automatically satisfy the required instrument training for the commercial certificate, unless it was specifically logged to satisfy both [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs|61.65]](e) and also [[FAR 61.129 CPL Aeronautical Experience|61.129]](a). See [[Hartzell 2010]] and [[Oord 2018]] legal interpretations.
	1. Stages of training in [[~ IR Lesson Plan Outline|syllabus]], Phase checks^[[[WVFC]] phase check published for members [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SWFJ0ebOeBLi8jAhSQdilPilrJiuOWzb)]
	2. Risk avoidance and management 
		1. Intro to multi-tasking, workload management, checklists 
		2. [[Personal Minimums]], [[Operational Pitfalls]], proficiency vs currency, [[PAVE]]
2. Instrument systems and power sources, flight characteristics, limitations, errors, pre-flight check methods 
	1. Required equipment for IFR flight, and IFR airworthiness requirements ([[FAR 91.205 Instrument and Equipment Requirements]])
		1. Mnemonic [[GRABCARDD]]
	2. [[FAR 91.213 Inop Equip]]
	3. Instruments
		1. Pitot-Static instruments: Altimeter (+/- 75’), Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, pitot heat (use below 10C or 50F, in visible moisture) 
			1. Pitot Heat check during preflight
		2. Gyro instruments: Attitude indicator, Heading Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator, Turn Coordinator, vacuum systems 
			1. DG precession limit - 3° in 15 minutes (industry suggestion)
		3. Magnetic [[Compass Errors]]: check freely turns during taxi check
		4. Electronic flight instrument display
			1. normally includes primary flight display ([[PFD]]) and multi-function display ([[MFD]]), sometimes on a single screen
			2. [[AHRS]] (Attitude and Heading Reference System) replaces conventional gyroscopic instrument
				1. AHRS uses Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to detect roll, pitch, and yaw. It corrects for drift over time using magnetometers (to find magnetic north) and accelerometers (to find “down” from Earth’s gravity).
			3. [[ADC]] does computations using pitot/static
		8. Flight management system ([[FMS]]) (AIM 1-2-1)
			1. Suite of sensors, receivers, and computers couples with navigation database
			2. Provide performance and RNAV guidance to displays and automation
			3. Inputs can be accepted from multiple sources - [[GPS]], [[DME]], [[VOR]], LOC
			4. Inputs may be applied to navigation solution one at a time or with any combination
		9. Multifunction display, if installed
			1. Used in conjunction with PFD
			2. Contains various additional information (maps, weather, engine performance, etc)
			3. Often can be used as a backup to PFD (e.g. reversionary mode)
		10. [[TAA]] definition
	4. Transponder and altitude encoders
		1. Blind Encoder (cheaper, no integrated with altimeter) vs. Encoding Altimeter (transponder integrated with altimeter)
		2. Connected to static line
		3. Mode A (squawk code + position) vs Mode C (squawk code + position + altitude)
		4. OFF (no power), STBY (no interrogation responses), ON (responses in Mode A), ALT (responds in Mode C)
		5. Set to ALT (Lights, Camera, Action, Time check)
	5. [[ADS-B]] weather/traffic
	6. Radio: Look for TX, RX
	7. #G1000 specific topics: 
		1. [[AHRS]] vs [[ADC]] – what are they, what do you do if they fail?
		2. Electrical system – how do you know if the alternator has failed? 
		3. If you are running on Standby battery – what still functions?
			1. PFD, AHRS, [[ADC]], Com1, Nav1, stby inst lights, stby bus 
			2. voltmeter. (NOTHING ELSE, like flaps, transponder, lights, etc) 
	8. Power Instruments: Engine gauges, Electronic engine instruments
	9. Electrical instruments: ammeter, voltmeter, alternator 
	10. Navigation radios and databases 
		1. [[VOR]] Checks
			1. 30 Day [[Ground-Based Navigation using VOR, DME, and ILS#VOR Checks]]
			2. [[VOT]], GND VOR checkpoint, airborne VOR, Dual VOR
		3. GPS 
			1. [[WAAS]] vs non-WAAS
			2. [[RAIM]] Check RAIM (RAIM prediction with old-style GPS, website: sapt.faa.gov)
			3. [Real-Time WAAS and GPS Monitoring](https://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/realtime-plots.html)
			4. [[GPS]] Status Page
			5. Operational Checks
			6. 28-day GPS cycle
	11. Procedures and documentation for flying with [[FAR 91.213 Inop Equip|inoperative equipment]]
