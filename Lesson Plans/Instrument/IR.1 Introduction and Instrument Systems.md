### Objective
Develop understanding of IFR flight training process, and detailed knowledge of instrument systems and pre-flight checks.

### References
- [[Appendix IR.D - Instrument Rating Flight Experience Requirements]]
- [[IFH]] Ch. 5-6
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]] 

### Builds On
[[PPL.19 Navigation Systems and Other Equipment]]

### Schedule
Ground 3 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Overview of [[IFR]] flight training process, syllabus overview 
	1. Aircraft choice, high performance, traditional vs technically advanced. Time and cost commitment and scheduling 
		1. Private: 70-90 hours, about $20k-$30k
		2. Instrument 40-60 hours, about $15k-$20k
		3. Simulation software and PC tools 
	2. Requirements for Instrument Rating ![[Appendix IR.D - Instrument Rating Flight Experience Requirements]]
	3. Airman Certification Standards ([[Instrument ACS]]) and Knowledge (written) test
	4. Recency of experience [[FAR 61.57 Recent Flight Experience]], logbook records 61.51, personal minimums 
		1. Logging [[IAP]], what’s required  ([[InFO15012]])
	5. Stages of training, Phase checks 
	6. Risk avoidance and management 
		1. Intro to multi-tasking, workload management, checklists 
		2. [[Personal Minimums]], “get-there-itis”, proficiency vs currency, [[PAVE]] 
2. Instrument systems and power sources, flight characteristics, limitations, errors, pre-flight check methods 
	1. Required equipment for IFR flight, and IFR airworthiness requirements ([[FAR 91.205]])
		1. Mnemonic [[GRABCARDD]]
	2. Inoperative equipment – [[MEL]], placarding - [[FAR 91.213 Inop Equip]]
	3. Pitot-Static instruments: Altimeter (+/- 75’), Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, pitot heat (use below 10C or 50F, in visible moisture) 
		1. Pitot Heat check during preflight
	4. Gyro instruments: Attitude indicator, Heading Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator, Turn Coordinator, vacuum systems 
		1. DG precession limit - 3° in 15 minutes (industry suggestion)
	5. Magnetic [[Compass Errors]]: check freely turns during taxi check
	6. Transponder and altitude encoders
		1. Blind Encoder (cheaper, no integrated with altimeter) vs. Encoding Altimeter (transponder integrated with altimeter)
		2. Connected to static line
		3. Mode A (squawk code + position) vs Mode C (squawk code + position + altitude)
		4. OFF (no power), STBY (no interrogation responses), ON (responses in Mode A), ALT (responds in Mode C)
		5. Set to ALT (Lights, Camera, Action, Time check)
	7. Radio: Look for TX, RX
	8. #G1000 specific topics: 
		1. [[AHRS]] vs ADC – what are they, what do you do if they fail?
		2. Electrical system – how do you know if the alternator has failed? 
		3. If you are running on Standby battery – what still functions?
			1. PFD, AHRS, [[ADC]], Com1, Nav1, stby inst lights, stby bus 
			2. voltmeter. (NOTHING ELSE, like flaps, transponder, lights, etc) 
	9. Power Instruments: Engine gauges, Electronic engine instruments
	10. Electrical instruments: ammeter, voltmeter, alternator 
	11. Navigation radios and databases 
		1. [[VOR]] Checks
			1. 30-day VOR check
			2. [[VOT]], GND VOR, airborne VOR, Dual VOR
		3. GPS 
			1. [[WAAS]] vs non-WAAS
			2. [[RAIM]] Check RAIM (RAIM prediction with old-style GPS, website: sapt.faa.gov)
			3. [Real-Time WAAS and GPS Monitoring](https://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/realtime-plots.html)
			4. [[GPS]] Status Page
			5. Operational Checks
			6. 28-day GPS cycle
	12. Electronic displays: [[PFD]], [[MFD]], [[TAA]] definition, [[ADS-B]] weather/traffic
	13. Autopilot systems, including preflight procedures and common failure modes 
	14. Electronic flight bags ([[EFB]]s) and automation management 
	15. Anti-icing systems 
		1. [[OAT]] Probe
		2. De-ice vs anti-ice
	16. Procedures and documentation for flying with inoperative equipment
