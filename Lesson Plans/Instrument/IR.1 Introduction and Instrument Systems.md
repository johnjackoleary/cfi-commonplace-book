### Introduction
Flying on instruments takes everything you've learned so far, and adds a whole new world of procedures and processes. You may have heard IFR described as the other 50% of aviation -- while the flying fundamentals and systems are familiar, the new knowledge required is comparable in size to everything you learned for PPL.

To set us up for training success, we'll start with a review of the instrument systems and pre-flight procedures you learned in [[PPL]] training. We'll also cover the [[IFR]] flight training process and requirements, so you know what is coming in the future.

**Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework:** [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]
**Builds On:** [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]
**Schedule:** Ground 1-3 hours, depending on recall from [[PPL]]

### Lesson Elements
1. Overview of [[IFR]] flight training process, syllabus overview
	1. [[TSA]], onboarding, etc
	2. Aircraft choice, [[Choosing a Ground School|ground school choice]], high performance, traditional vs technically advanced. Time and cost commitment and scheduling 
		1. Private: 70-90 hours, about $20k-$30k
		2. Instrument 40-60 hours, about $15k-$20k
		3. Simulation software and PC tools
		4. Use of [[AATD]]/[[BATD]] and [[safety pilot]] to reduce costs
	3. [[IR.A Instrument Rating Flight Experience Requirements]]
		1. Part of training can be done with a [[Safety Pilot]]
		2. Part of training can be done with an instructor in an [[AATD]] like the PFC1000s at [[WVFC]]
	4. Airman Certification Standards ([[Instrument ACS]]) and Knowledge (written) test
	5. Recency of experience [[FAR 61.57 Recent Flight Experience]] and [[FAR 61.51 Pilot Logbooks]]
		1. [[6 HITS]]
		2. Logging [[IAP]], what’s required  ([[InFO 15012]])
		3. > [!warning] For future commercial pilots
		   > This time does NOT automatically satisfy the required instrument training for the commercial certificate, unless it was specifically logged to satisfy both [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs|61.65]](d) and also [[FAR 61.129 CPL Experience Reqs|61.129]](a). See [[Hartzell 2010]] and [[Oord 2018]] legal interpretations.
	6. Stages of training in [[~ IR Lesson Plan Outline|syllabus]], Phase checks^[[[WVFC]] phase check published for members [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SWFJ0ebOeBLi8jAhSQdilPilrJiuOWzb)]
	7. Risk avoidance and management 
		1. Intro to multi-tasking, workload management, checklists 
		2. [[Personal Minimums]], [[Operational Pitfalls]], proficiency vs currency, [[PAVE]]
2. [[Aircraft Instruments]] and power sources, flight characteristics, limitations, errors, pre-flight check methods 
	1. Required equipment for IFR flight, and IFR airworthiness requirements ([[FAR 91.205 Instrument and Equipment Requirements]])
		1. Mnemonic [[GRABCARDD]]
	2. [[FAR 91.213 Inop Equip]]
	3. Instruments
		1. Pitot-Static instruments: Altimeter (+/- 75’), Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, pitot heat (use below 10C or 50F, in visible moisture) 
			1. Pitot Heat check during preflight
		2. Gyro instruments: Attitude indicator, Heading Indicator, Turn Coordinator, vacuum systems 
			1. [[DG]] precession limit - 3° in 15 minutes (industry suggestion)
			2. Horizontal Situation Indicator ([[HSI]])
		3. Magnetic [[Compass Errors]]: check freely turns during taxi check
		4. Electronic flight instrument display
			1. normally includes primary flight display ([[PFD]]) and multi-function display ([[MFD]]), sometimes on a single screen
			2. [[AHRS]] (Attitude and Heading Reference System) replaces conventional gyroscopic instrument
				1. AHRS uses Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to detect roll, pitch, and yaw. It corrects for drift over time using magnetometers (to find magnetic north) and accelerometers (to find “down” from Earth’s gravity).
				2. > [!warning] Synthetic vision can cause pitch scale change
			3. [[ADC]] does computations using pitot/static
		5. Flight management system ([[FMS]]) (AIM 1-2-1)
			1. Suite of sensors, receivers, and computers couples with navigation database
			2. Provide performance and RNAV guidance to displays and automation
			3. Inputs can be accepted from multiple sources - [[GPS]], [[DME]], [[VOR]], LOC
			4. Inputs may be applied to navigation solution one at a time or with any combination
		6. Multifunction display, if installed
			1. Used in conjunction with PFD
			2. Contains various additional information (maps, weather, engine performance, etc)
			3. Often can be used as a backup to PFD (e.g. [[reversionary mode]])
		7. Technically Advanced Aircraft ([[Technically Advanced Aircraft|TAA]]) definition
	4. [[Transponder]] and altitude encoders
		1. Blind Encoder (cheaper, not integrated with altimeter) vs. Encoding Altimeter (transponder integrated with altimeter)
		2. Connected to static line
		3. Mode A (squawk code + position) vs Mode C (squawk code + position + altitude)
		4. OFF (no power), STBY (no interrogation responses), ON (responses in Mode A), ALT (responds in Mode C), GND
			1. Use ALT mode on the ground^[[[AIM 4]]-1-20]
		5. Mode S - transmits additional info like heading, speed
		6. Set to ALT ([[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]] check)
	5. [[ADS-B]] weather/traffic
	6. Radio: Look for [[TX]], [[RX]]
	7. #G1000 specific topics: 
		1. [[AHRS]] vs [[ADC]] – what are they, what do you do if they fail?
		2. Electrical system – how do you know if the alternator has failed? 
			1. [[C172 G1000 Electrical System Interactive Tool]]
		3. If you are running on Standby battery – what still functions?
			1. [[PFD]], [[AHRS]], [[ADC]], Com1, Nav1, standby instrument lights, essentials bus
			2. (NOTHING ELSE, like flaps, transponder, lights, audio panel, etc) 
	8. Power Instruments: Engine gauges, Electronic engine instruments
	9. Electrical instruments: ammeter, voltmeter, alternator 
	10. Navigation radios and databases 
		1. Covered in depth as part of [[IR.5A Ground-Based Navigation]] and [[IR.5B Satellite Navigation]]
