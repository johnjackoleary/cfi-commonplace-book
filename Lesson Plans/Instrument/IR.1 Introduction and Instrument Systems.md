### Lesson Elements
1. Overview of IFR flight training process, syllabus overview 
   1. Aircraft choice, high performance, traditional vs technically advanced. Time and cost commitment and scheduling 
      1. Private: 60-80 hours, about $20k 
      2. Instrument 40-60 hours, about $15k 
      3. Simulation software and PC tools 
   2. Requirements for Instrument Rating [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Requirements]]
      1. General
         1. Current Private Pilot
         2. English
         3. Receive and Log Ground Training 61.65(b)
         4. Endorsement for Written
         5. Receive and Log Flight Training 
         6. Logbook Endorsement for Practical
         7. Pass Written
         8. Pass Practical
      2. Aeronautical Experience 61.57
         1. 50 hours XC PIC, 10 hrs in Airplane
         2. 40 hours actual or simulated instrument, 15 from an authorized instructor
         3. 3 hours of instrument flight training from CFII within 2 months of practical
         4. Long Instrument XC
            1. 250nm along airways
            2. IAP at each airport
            3. 3 different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems
   3. Airman Certification Standards (ACS) and Knowledge (written) test
   4. Recency of experience [[FAR 61.57 Recent Flight Experience]], logbook records 61.51, personal minimums 
      1. Logging IAP, what’s required  ([[InFO15012]])
   5. Stages of training, Phase checks 
   6. Risk avoidance and management 
      1. Intro to multi-tasking, workload management, checklists 
      2. [[Personal Minimums]], “get-there-itis”, proficiency vs currency, [[PAVE]] 
2. Instrument systems and power sources, flight characteristics, limitations, errors, pre-flight check methods 
   1. Required equipment for IFR flight, and IFR airworthiness requirements 
      1. Mnemonic [[GRABCARDD]]: Generator, Rate of Turn, Attitude, Ball, Clock, Altimeter (sensitive), Radios, DG, DME (above FL240) 
   2. Inoperative equipment – MEL, placarding 
   3. Pitot-Static instruments: Altimeter (+/- 75’), Airspeed Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator, pitot heat (use below 10C or 50F, in visible moisture) 
      1. Pitot Heat check during preflight
   4. Gyro instruments: Attitude indicator, Heading Indicator, Horizontal Situation Indicator, Turn Coordinator, vacuum systems 
      1. DG precession limit - 3° in 15 minutes (industry suggestion)
   5. Magnetic Compass: Northerly turning errors, acceleration errors, deviation card. Mnemonics: ANDS, UNOS, freely turns during taxi check
   6. Transponder and altitude encoders
      1. Blind Encoder (cheaper, no integrated with altimeter) vs. Encoding Altimeter (transponder integrated with altimeter)
      2. Connected to static line
      3. Mode A (squawk code + position) vs Mode C (squawk code + position + altitude)
      4. OFF (no power), STBY (no interrogation responses), ON (responses in Mode A), ALT (responds in Mode C)
      5. Set to ALT (Lights, Camera, Action, Time check)
   7. Radio
      1. Look for TX, RX
   8. #G1000 specific topics: 
      1. [[AHRS]] vs ADC – what are they, what do you do if they fail?
      2. Electrical system – how do you know if the alternator has failed? 
      3. If you are running on Standby battery – what still functions?
         1. PFD, AHRS, [[ADC]], Com1, Nav1, stby inst lights, stby bus 
         2. voltmeter. (NOTHING ELSE, like flaps, transponder, lights, etc) 
   9. Power Instruments: Engine gauges, Electronic engine instruments
   10. Electrical instruments: ammeter, voltmeter, alternator 
   11. Navigation radios and databases (30-day VOR check, 28-day GPS cycle) 
      1. Types of [[VOR]] Checks - VOT, GND VOR, airborne VOR, Dual VOR
      2. GPS 
         1. [[WAAS]] vs non-WAAS
         2. [[RAIM]] Check
         3. [Real-Time WAAS and GPS Monitoring](https://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/realtime-plots.html)
         4. [[GPS]] Status Page
      3. checks

   13. Autopilot systems, including preflight procedures and common failure modes 
   14. Electronic flight bags ([[EFB]]s) and automation management 
   15. GPS
      1. database currency and operational tests
      2. RAIM (RAIM prediction with old-style GPS, website: sapt.faa.gov), WAAS 
   16. Anti-icing systems 
      1. [[OAT]] Probe
      2. De-ice vs anti-ice
   17. Procedures and documentation for flying with inoperative equipment
