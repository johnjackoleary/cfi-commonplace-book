	3. 3 different kinds of approaches (VOR, GPS, ILS) 
2. IFR cross country flight planning: 
	1. Symbology on IFR enroute and approach charts 
	2. Preparing navigation log (paper and EFB) and using preferred IFR routing. 
	3. Fuel planning and monitoring, and definitions of minimum and emergency fuel 
	4. Alternate airport selection and planning 
	5. Obtaining weather briefings, including NOTAMS and adverse conditions such as icing, wind shear and turbulence. 
	6. Personal minimums and go/no-go decisions. 
	7. Filing IFR flight plan, and procedures for activating and closing IFR flight plans
	8. Knowledge of GPS and RAIM capability and prediction, if necessary
3. Enroute procedures
	1. Required reports and position report format 
	2. Fuel planning and monitoring, re-calculating fuel reserves 
	3. Weather updates 
	4. Route changes 
	5. Diversion to alternate 
4. [[Lost Communications]] ([[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms]])
5. Common errors 
	1. Inadequate preflight planning and briefings 
	2. Incorrect understanding of non-standard takeoff minimums and alternate minimums
