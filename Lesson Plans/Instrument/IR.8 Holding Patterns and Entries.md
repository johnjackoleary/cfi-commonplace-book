### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying holding patterns, including recommended entry procedures, while satisfying ACS standards. 

### Resources
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]]
- GPS manual
- [Practice problems](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/5101/files/Holding.pdf?1141) from thebackseatpilot.com

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[IR.5A VOR Navigation]]
- [[IR.5B GPS Navigation]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hour, simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Why Holds?
	1. Traffic or weather
	2. Keeps aircraft in specified airspace awaiting clearance
	3. Types of fixes: VOR, intersection, VOR/DME, GPS waypoint
	4. [[HILPT]]
2. Published vs unpublished holds
3. Protected Airspace
	1. Maximum airspeeds
		1. MHA-6,000‚Äô: 200kts
		2. 6,001‚Äô-14,000‚Äô: 230kts
		3. 14,001‚Äô+: 265kts
		4. Or as depicted/given by ATC
4. Entries ([[AIM 5]]-3-8)
	1. Types
		1. Direct (turn to outbound heading)
		2. Parallel (first turn direction is OPPOSITE of hold turns.)
			1. VOR vs GPS turning to outbound
		3. Teardrop (turn with 30¬∞ offset from outbound leg)
	2. Tips for determining hold entry
		1. Method 1: Cover top right/left with thumb, depending on right/left turns 
			1. If outbound leg in that 70¬∞ section, **teardrop**.
			2. Below the thumb and for the next 180¬∞, **direct**.
			3. Opposite side from the inbound heading for 110¬∞, **parallel**
		2. Method 2: Use right/left hand, depending on turn direction, and rotate to wrist to outbound heading
			1. If it's "painful" (wrist rotating to outside of body), **teardrop**^[Tears for the pain üò¢]
			2. If not painful (wrist rotating toward body), **parallel**
			3. For anything beyond 70¬∞ of teardrop and 110¬∞ of parallel, **direct**
		3. Method 3: No-Math Hold Entry / Visualize the approach^[from Feb 2025 of [[IFR Magazine]]]
			1. [[TLAR]] method, and not amusing to a [[DPE]]
			2. > [!quote] *Holding Entry* from [[IFR Magazine]], Feb 2025
			> 1. If your heading to the holding fix takes you across the fix and outside the hold, that is a parallel. You would turn as appropriate, to parallel the inbound course for one minute before turning back towards the hold to the holding fix, again, per the AIM.
			> 2. If your heading takes you across the holding fix and then into the hold, that is a teardrop entry. Crossing the holding fix, proceed as per the AIM.
			> 3. If your heading is taking you directly to the fix or navaid that makes up the hold, and you are able to simply, directly make the correct turn entering the hold, then that is a direct entry.
		4. Method 4: 'Draw' the entry on the heading indicator
			1. #todo :: Add more info on this method
		5. Method 5: Draw the entry in a notebook
			1. Generally too slow to do in flight
		6. Method 6: [[MFD]] or [[EFB]] plotting
			1. Learn to program them efficiently to provide a backup on one of the above
5. Flying Hold
	1. Workload Management
		1. [[5 Ts]]: Time, Turn, Twist, Throttle, Talk 
	2. Standard Turns = Right!
	3. DME/GPS vs. not
		1. When not DME/GPS: 1min standard inbound leg (below 14000‚Äô)
		2. When using DME/GPS: 4nm diagonal distance (extra info from IFR-Magazine)
	4. Holding Turns: Standard Rate (3¬∞ per second)
6. Accounting for Wind
	1. Crosswind correction during pattern
		1. Determine cross-wind correction on inbound leg, and TRIPLE it on outbound leg (AIM 5-3-8)
	2. More info from [[AOPA]] in [On Instruments: Flying in Place](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2020/september/pilot/on-instruments-holding-patterns)
7. Clearances ([[Sample Holding Clearances]])
	1. > [!quote] From [[AIM 5]]-3
		> 1. Direction of holding from the fix in terms of the eight cardinal compass points (i.e., N, NE, E, SE, etc.).
		> 2. Holding fix (the fix may be omitted if included at the beginning of the transmission as the clearance limit).
		> 3. Radial, course, bearing, airway or route on which the aircraft is to hold.
		> 4. Leg length in miles if [[DME]]¬†or¬†[[RNAV]]¬†is to be used (leg length will be specified in minutes on pilot request or if the controller considers it necessary).
		> 5. Direction of turn if left turns are to be made, the pilot requests, or the controller considers it necessary.
		> 6. Time to expect further clearance ([[EFC]]) and any pertinent additional delay information.
8. Common Errors
	1. Wasting fuel - use slow cruise or even max endurance speed if fuel is a factor
	2. GPS confusion
	3. Incorrect entry choice
	4. Insufficient wind correction
	5. Fuel monitoring and ‚Äúminimum fuel‚Äù situations ([Avianca Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_052))
