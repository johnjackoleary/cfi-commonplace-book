### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying VOR and circling approaches. 

### Resources
- [[FAR 91.175 IFR Takeoff and Landing]]
- POH/AFM

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[IR.5A Ground-Based Navigation]]
[[IR.10 Approach Charts and Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, simulator 2 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. [[VOR]] Approaches
	1. Sensitivity based on VOR location
2. [[DME]] Arcs: [[Ground-Based Navigation using VOR, DME, and ILS#DME Arcs Procedure]]
3. Circle to land approaches (AIM 5-4-20)
	1. Approach chart named with letter instead of runway number OR a circling approach might be preferred if the straight in runway is not usable because of wind or other reasons
	2. Review circling minimums and notes on approach chart 
	3. Review circling approach protected areas (maneuvering radius)
		1. 1.3nm from each runway end for Category A at most altitudes
		2. AIM 5-4-20
	4. How to circle
	5. Loss of flight visibility or airport, execute missed 
	6. Missed approach during circle-to-land procedure (AIM 5-4-21)
	7. Personal minimums
4. Common errors 
	1. Unstable approaches 
	2. Failure to configure aircraft for approach and landing 
	3. Failure to manage automation
	4. Descent below [[MDA]] (+100’/-0’ at MDA) 
	5. Using wrong navigation source during approach 
	6. Loss of sequencing with GPS during missed approach 
	7. Loss of situational awareness during missed approach or circling approach 
5. Sim Activity
	1. [KPRB VOR-B](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=00858VB.PDF) from EXUPY using GPS
	2. [KPRB VOR 19](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=00858V19.PDF) from JEBNO without GPS
	3. [KPRB VOR-B](https://cfijack.com/latest-plate-redirect/?plate=00858VB.PDF) from JEBNO

### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at flying non-precision approaches to ACS standards to landing, including circling approaches, and missed approach procedures.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Instrument approach procedures
