### Objective
Develop the pilot's knowledge, skill and risk management associated with planning an IFR cross-country and filing a flight plan. Plan and fly instrument cross-country flight to satisfy aeronautical experience in [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]].

### Builds On

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours, Flight 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. IFR cross-country requirement before checkride 
	1. IFR flight of 250 nm minimum 
	2. An instrument approach at each airport 
	3. 3 different kinds of approaches (VOR, GPS, ILS) 
2. IFR cross country flight planning: 
	1. Symbology on IFR enroute and approach charts 
	2. Preparing navigation log (paper and EFB) and using preferred IFR routing. 
	3. Fuel planning and monitoring, and definitions of minimum and emergency fuel 
	4. Alternate airport selection and planning 
	5. Obtaining weather briefings, including NOTAMS and adverse conditions such as icing, wind shear and turbulence. 
	6. Personal minimums and go/no-go decisions. 
	7. Filing IFR flight plan, and procedures for activating and closing IFR flight plans
	8. Knowledge of GPS and RAIM capability and prediction, if necessary
3. Enroute procedures: 
	1. Required reports and position report format 
	2. Fuel planning and monitoring, re-calculating fuel reserves 
	3. Weather updates 
	4. Route changes 
	5. Diversion to alternate 
4.  Loss of Communications ([[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms]])
	1. Squawk 7600 
	2. In VMC, continue VFR, land as soon as practicable. 
	3. In IMC: 
		1. For Route, use mnemonic AVE-F – Assigned, Vectored, Expected, then Filed (in that order of priority) 
		2. For Altitude on each route segment, use highest of mnemonic MEA – Minimum (MEA), Expected, Assigned 
		3. Leave Clearance Limit
			1. When at fix from which approach begins, leave at EFC time if given, otherwise commence descent as close as possible to ETA
			2. When not at a fix from which approach begins, leave clearance limit at the EFC time if received and proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA. Otherwise upon arrival over the clearance limit, proceed to a fix from which an approach begins; commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA
5. Common errors 
	1. Inadequate preflight planning and briefings 
	2. Incorrect understanding of non-standard takeoff minimums and alternate minimums 
### Completion Standards
To demonstrate knowledge, skill, and judgment in IFR cross country planning to meet the applicable ACS standards. Completion of the instrument cross-country flight to satisfy aeronautical experience in FAR 61.65.
