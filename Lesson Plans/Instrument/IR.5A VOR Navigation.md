### Objective
VOR orientation, course intercepts and tracking, and use of HSI, if available. Autopilot systems and operation.

Should this title be VOR and ILS

### Resources
- [[Instrument ACS]] section V
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]
- [[IR.3 Instrument Aircraft Control, Practice Maneuvers, Aircraft Gaits]]
- [[IR.4 Flight Deck Organization, Workload and Automation Management]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour; simulator and/or airplane, 2 hours^[may need less time based on depth of PPL training]

### Lesson Elements
1. VOR Information from [[Ground-Based Navigation using VOR, DME, and ILS]]
2. Common Errors 
	1. Incorrect tuning and identification procedures 
	2. Failure to set navigation selector for the course to be intercepted (GPS vs VOR/VLOC switch) 

### Completion Standards
Student must be able to tune and ID VOR navaid, detect failures; check receiver for proper operation; orient to a VOR station or course; intercept assigned course; track course to or from VOR, with crosswind correction; Maintain heading within 10Â°s, altitude within 100 feet, airspeed within 10 kts. Student must know how to check autopilot operation during preflight, and how to use autopilot during enroute flight.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]]:
- Navigation systems
