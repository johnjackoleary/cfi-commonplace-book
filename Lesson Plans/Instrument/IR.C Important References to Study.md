		1. #todo :: this article seems to have disappeared. FAA has a semi-useful resource [here](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/events/SO/SO09/2021/SO09104630/G1000_System_Components_QuickRef_Guide.pdf)
	3. G1000 failure mode guidance for CFIs and DPEs: [[G1000 Guide for Designated Pilot Examiners and Certified Flight Instructors]]

#todo :: would be good to combine this with [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]
