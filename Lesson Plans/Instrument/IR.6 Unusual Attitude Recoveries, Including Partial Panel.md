### Objective
Develop student knowledge and skill in recognition of and recovery from unusual attitudes, with full- and partial-panel operations. 

### References
None

### Builds On
[[PPL.1 Emergency Flight by Instruments - Unusual Attitude Recovery]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5-hour, simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Causes of unusual flight attitudes 
	1. Failure to properly trim the controls 
	2. Distraction, or fixation 
	3. Turbulence and Wake Turbulence 
2. Diagnosing system failures
	1. [[Inverted-V Scan]] to detect anomalies by comparing vacuum gyro ([[AI]]) to electric gyro ([[TC]]) to pitot/static ([[VSI]])
	2. Bank triangle (most critical): [[AI]], [[TC]], Compass ([[HI]]) 
	3. Pitch triangle: [[AI]], Altimeter, [[VSI]] ([[ASI]], vacuum gauge)
3. Unusual Attitude Recoveries (IFH 7-26) 
	1. Unusual attitudes are those not normally required during instrument flight. Recovery includes prompt return to straight-and-level flight 
	2. Full panel recoveries 
	3. Partial panel recoveries 
4. 3. Recognize nose-high unusual attitude: 
	1. ASI slow or decreasing rapidly 
	2. VSI shows climb, altimeter shows climb 
	3. TC shows turn 
	4. Recovery: 
		1. Power-Pitch-Bank (must become 2nd nature!) 
		2. Full-power - Pitch Down - Level Wings 
5. Recognize nose-low unusual attitude: 
	1. ASI fast or increasing rapidly 
	2. VSI negative rate, altimeter shows descent 
	3. TC shows turn 
	4. Recovery: 
		1. Power-Bank-Pitch (must become 2nd nature!) 
		2. Reduce power - Level Wings - Pitch Up 
6. Common errors 
	1. Failure to recognize unusual attitude 
	2. Dependence on senses other than instrument indications 
	3. Failure to use proper recovery sequence, i.e. power-pitch-bank for nose high, and power-bank-pitch for nose low 
### Completion Standards
Student demonstrates the ability to recognize, confirm, and recover from unusual attitudes, applying the appropriate pitch, bank, and power corrections in the correct sequence to return the aircraft to a stabilized level flight attitude.
