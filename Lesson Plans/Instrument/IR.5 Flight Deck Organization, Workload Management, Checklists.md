### Objective
Memorize common mental checklists and learn to use mental checklists and flow patterns backed up by written checklists. 

### References



### Builds On
- [[PPL.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour 

### Lesson Elements
1. [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]]
2. Digital Charts ([[EFB]])
	1. Pros - lighter, backlighting, digital updates, GPS integration, EFB can include more than just charts (TIS-B, Datalink weather, W+B, Chart supplements)
	2. Cons - Battery, fragile, can’t update inflight, expensive
3. Paper Charts
	1. Pros - Don’t require battery, less fragile than EFB
	2. Cons - Expire, no search function, take space and weight
4. Mounting
	1. Yoke, kneeboard, suction
5. Chart and database currency
	1. Every 56 days (8 weeks)
	2. [[FAA]] vs. Jeppesen
6. Use of BOTH written and mental checklists 
	1. Use mental checklists and flow patterns 
	2. Double check and back-up with written checklists 
7. Mental checklists 
	1. Before takeoff: [[CIGARS]] – Controls, Instruments, Gas, Attitude, Runup, Seatbelts and Switches 
	2. Before taking runway: – Lights, Camera (transponder), Action, Time
	3. Before landing: [[GUMPS]] – Gas, Undercarriage, Mixture, Prop, Seatbelts and Switches 
	4. Approach briefing: [[AIRBAG]] or [[WRIMTMS]] - ATIS/AWOS, Install Approach, Radios/Radials, Brief Approach and Going Missed
	5. 5 Ts: Time (start timer), Turn, Throttle, Tune and/or Twist (nav freq and OBS), Talk 
	6. Non-radar position reports: [[PTATEN]] Position, Time, Altitude, Type of flight plan (only required for FSS reports), Estimated time of arrival at the next reporting point, Name of the reporting point after that
8. Common Errors 
	1. Forgetting to use mental checklists 
	2. Rushing to keep up with the plane 
	3. Diverting attention during maneuvers like turning, or before reaching altitude. 
	4. Not recognizing fatigue and task saturation

### Completion Standards
The student must demonstrate the ability to prioritize tasks during IFR flight, “stay ahead” of the airplane by using mental checklists and written checklists.
