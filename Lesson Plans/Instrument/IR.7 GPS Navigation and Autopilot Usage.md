### Objective
Develop detailed understanding of GPS system and navigation; become proficient with particular GPS installation, displays, and autopilot interfaces; become proficient at using GPS in-flight, including modifying flight plan and changing approaches.

### Builds On

### Schedule
Ground 1.5-hour, simulator and/or airplane, 1.5 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. GNSS
	1. GPS Constellation
		1. 24 Satellites, 12,000 miles above sfc of earth, each orbit earth 2x per 24 hours
	2. Calculating position
		1. Calculates distance between satellites and receivers via atomic clock
2. RAIM + Satellites Required
	1. 4 Satellites for 3D
	2. RAIM requires 5 satellites or 4 + barometric altimeter input
	3. FDE (Fault Detection + Exclusion) 
		1. Excludes a failed satellite from the position solution; GPS receivers capable of FDE require 6 satellites or 5 satellites with baro-aiding
3. WAAS (TSO-145,TSO-146)
	1. Wide Area Augmentation System
	2. Uses reference stations with known locations to determine GPS error for a wide area
	3. Error info sent to WA Master Station, then uplinked to Geosynchronous Satellite that broadcasts to WAAS receivers
4. IFR flight Using GPS
	1. Installation approval and operational approval required
	2. TSO 129/196 (Non-WAAS) requires alternate approved and operational means of navigation
	3. Expired database
		1. IFR enroute/terminal - verification of data for correctness
		2. IFR approach - current database or verification procedure has not been amended since expiration of database
5. GPS Sensitivity
	1. Enroute  ±2nm, default
	2. Terminal - ±1nm
		1. Within 31nm of destination
		2. In term on dep until beyond 30nm from departure
	3. Approach - ±0.3nm 
		1. 2.0nm from FAF
6. GPS Functions
	1. GPS Approaches		  
		1. LNAV, LP, LPV
		2. LNAV/VNAV, +V
	2. Flight Plan
	3. Direct to
	4. OBS
	5. Airport/NAVAID Information
	6. Flight calculations
7. Managing risk of various GPS idiosyncrasies
	1. How to suspend GPS sequencing for multiple turns in a hold? 
	2. How to resume approach after holding? 
	3. Pop-up or other method to resume sequencing to missed approach point
	4. Use of vectors to final (VTF) with GPS (don’t do it!) 
	5. Using GPS for guidance on ILS and VOR approaches – how and when to transition from GPS guidance to VOR or Localizer? Auto or manual?
8. Autopilot
	1. Single axis vs. Dual axis
	2. Functions
9. Common Errors
	1. Not knowing your GPS (GPS simulation software for home practice is great!)
	2. VLOC vs GPS
	3. Switching autopilot between GPS, VOR, heading bug, etc. 
	4. Risk management - New or unfamiliar GPS demands significant practice with VFR conditions before using in IMC! GPS brings impressive capabilities and situational awareness, but at the risk of significant complexity and variability between systems! 
### Completion Standards
Student must understand the different types of GPS installations and “flavors” of GPS approaches. Student must become proficient at creating GPS flight plans, navigating with GPS, and modifying flight plans and approach selections. Student must understand particular GPS techniques for holding and flying missed approaches and using autopilot interfaces (if installed).
