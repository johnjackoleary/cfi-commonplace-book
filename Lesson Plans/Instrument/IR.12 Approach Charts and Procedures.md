### Objective
Develop an understanding to interpret, apply, and brief various types of charted instrument approach procedures. 

### References
AIM Ch 5-4, [[IFH]] Ch 10, IPH Ch. 4, FAR 91.175 

### Resources
- [Instrument Approaches in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area](https://sites.google.com/coyotehillconsulting.com/cfiwes/library/instrument-approaches) by [[Wes Irish]]

### Builds On
- [[IR.5 Flight Deck Organization, Workload Management, Checklists]]
- [[IR.9 Airspace, Charts, Flight Planning and Enroute Operations]]
- [[IR.11 Communications, Clearances, Lost Communications Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours, and likely start [[IR.13A RNAV (GPS) Approaches]]

### Lesson Elements
1. Precision vs. Non Precision
	1. Precision
		1. [[ILS]] 
		2. [[PAR]] 
		3. GPS [[LPV]] (technically, not precision approach, but included here because of similarity)
	2. Non-Precision
		1. Lateral Guidance Only
		2. Fly to a Minimum Descent Altitude
2. Approaches (Part 97)
	1. Reading plates 
	2. Approach categories: A <91 kts, B <121 kts, C <141 kts, D <166 kts, E >166 kts
	3. Parts of approach: Initial (IAF->IF), Intermediate (IF->FAF), Final (FAF->MAP), Missed (MAP->...)
3. Nav equipment considerations
	1. Use of GPS maps and guidance for initial approach (AC 90-108)
	2. Methods for switching CDI from GPS to VOR/LOC 
	3. CDI sensitivity changes during approach 
	4. Missed approach guidance – GPS guidance for missed approach 
4. ATC Approach Clearances
	1. https://www.ifr-magazine.com/technique/approach-clearance/
	2. [[When Are You Established]]?
5. Descent Profiles: 
	1. “Dive & Drive” vs [[CDFA]] (Continuous Descent Final Appr [[AC 120-108]])
	2. VDP
		1. When published, do not descend below MDA until past
		2. Good to calculate if not published 
			1. Take the AGL value of the MDA and divide it by 300
	3. MDA - what is required to continue descent? 
	4. Identifying MAP
		1. Timing from FAF to MAP
		2. GPS/DME
6. At DA – what is required to descend below DA or MDA? (FAR 91.175) 
	1. Continuously in position to land, with normal descent rate and maneuvers 
	2. AND Flight visibility >= minimum 
	3. AND any one of:
		1. ALS (approach light system), although only to TDZE+100’
		2. Threshold, threshold markings, threshold lights
		3. Runway end identifier lights
		4. Runway, runway markings, runway lights
		5. Touchdown zone, touchdown zone markings, touchdown zone lights
		6. VGSI
	4. Threshold
7. When is a missed approach required? ([[FAR 91.175]])
	1. At DA or MAP, if references above are not visible 
	2. If below MDA/DA, visibility < min OR lost view of airport references 
	3. During circling maneuver at or above MDA, airport not visible 
8. Missed approach 
	1. When to execute missed approach?
	2. Procedure: Cram, Climb, Cool, Configure, Call
	3. How to handle MA before MAP 
		1. Fly to MAP and 
	4. How to handle after MAP
		1. May choose to cancel IFR if conditions permit
		2. In ATC environment - immediately contact ATC to obtain amended clearance
		3. If unable to contact ATC, attempt to re-intercept published segment of missed approach
9. Circle to land approaches (AIM 5-4-20)
	1. Approach chart named with letter instead of runway number OR a circling approach might be preferred if the straight in runway is not usable because of wind or other reasons
	2. Review circling minimums and notes on approach chart 
	3. Review circling approach protected areas (maneuvering radius)
		1. 1.3nm from each runway end for Category A at most altitudes
		2. Old vs new approach categories
		3. AIM 5-4-20
	4. Loss of flight visibility or airport, execute missed 
	5. Missed approach during circle-to-land procedure (AIM 5-4-21)
10. Visual and Contact approaches: 
	1. Visual approach (AIM 5-4-23) – must have airport or preceding aircraft in sight, ceiling > 1000’ AGL, vis >3 SM 
	2. Contact approach (AIM 5-4-25) – pilot must request, vis >1 SM, clear of clouds 
11. Common errors 
	1. Getting “behind” the airplane, not ready for missed approach, failing to accomplish checklist items 
	2. Overcontrolling during final phase of approach, with high CDI sensitivity 
	3. Using wrong navigation source during approach 
	4. Unstable approach, failure to configure for approach and landing 
	5. Descent below DA (slight dip is allowed)


### Completion Standards
Learner understand the information contained in an approach plate and is able to brief an approach. Learner can describe how various elements of an approach plate will translate to procedures in flight.
