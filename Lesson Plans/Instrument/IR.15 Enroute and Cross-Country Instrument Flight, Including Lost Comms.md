### Objective
Develop the pilot's knowledge, skill and risk management associated with planning an IFR cross-country, choosing an alternate, and filing a flight plan, including [[Lost Communications]] procedures. Plan and fly instrument cross-country flight to satisfy aeronautical experience in [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]].

### Resources
- [[FAR 61.65 Instrument Rating Reqs]], 91.167-187
- [[Risk Management Handbook]]
- [[IFH]] / [[IPH]] 
- [[Instrument ACS]] Section 1.C
- [A good case study and analysis](https://aviationnewstalk.libsyn.com/342-n990pt-cirrus-sr22-fatal-accident-at-kbhb-bar-harbor-maine) by [[Max Trescott]]

### Builds On
[[IR.9 Communications and Clearances]]
[[IR.7 Airspace, Charts, Flight Planning and Enroute Operations]]
[[IR.14 IFR Weather and Weather Services]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours, Flight 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. IFR cross-country requirement before checkride ([[IR.A Instrument Rating Flight Experience Requirements]])
	1. IFR flight of 250 nm minimum 
	2. An instrument approach at each airport 
	3. 3 different kinds of approaches (VOR, GPS, ILS) 
2. IFR cross country flight planning: 
	1. Symbology on IFR enroute and approach charts 
	2. Preparing navigation log (paper and EFB) and using preferred IFR routing. 
	3. Fuel planning and monitoring, and definitions of minimum and emergency fuel 
		1. [Avianca Flight 052](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_052) #case-study
	4. Alternate airport selection and planning^[See also [[IR.7 Airspace, Charts, Flight Planning and Enroute Operations]]])
		1. Standard and alternate minimums
		2. [[1-2-3 Rule]]
		3. Non-WAAS impact on alternate
		4. [The Advantage Of Landing On Runways With An ILS](https://www.boldmethod.com/shorts/shorts.ifr.0103/)
	6. Obtaining weather briefings, including NOTAMS and adverse conditions such as icing, wind shear and turbulence. 
	7. [[Personal minimums]] and go/no-go decisions ([[Complete IFR Preflight Checklist]])
	8. Filing IFR flight plan, and procedures for activating and closing IFR flight plans
		1. Useful [ForeFlight resource](https://support.foreflight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049193173-ICAO-Equipment-and-PBN-Guide) for equipment codes
	9. Knowledge of [[GPS]] and [[RAIM]] capability and prediction, and when necessary to check
3. Enroute procedures
	1. Required reports and position report format ([[PTATEN]])
	2. Fuel planning and monitoring, re-calculating fuel reserves 
	3. Weather updates 
	4. Route changes 
	5. Diversion to alternate 
4. [[Lost Communications]] ([[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms]])
5. Common errors 
	1. Inadequate preflight planning and briefings 
	2. Incorrect understanding of non-standard takeoff minimums and alternate minimums

### Completion Standards
To demonstrate knowledge, skill, and judgment in IFR cross country planning to meet the applicable ACS standards. Completion of the instrument cross-country flight to satisfy aeronautical experience in FAR 61.65.
