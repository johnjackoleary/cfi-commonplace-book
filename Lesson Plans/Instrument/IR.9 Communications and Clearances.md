### Objective
Learn proper IFR communications techniques, include copying clearances, normal communications

### Resources
- [[FAR 91.185 Lost Comms]]
- [[IFH]] Appendix A (clearance shorthand)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as [[IR.10 Approach Charts and Procedures]].

### Lesson Elements
1. Communications
	1. Priorities: [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]] 
	2. Required reports ([[MARVELOUS VFR C500]]) - ([[AIM 5]]-3-3)
		1. Missed approach ([[5 C's (Going Missed)]])
		2. Airspeed changes more than 10 knots or 5 percent
		3. Reaching a holding fix
		4. [[VFR-On-Top]] altitude change
		5. ETA change more than 3 minutes (no radar)
		6. Leaving a holding fix
		7. Outer marker inbound (no radar)
		8. Unforecast weather
		9. Safety of flight issues
		10. Vacating an altitude
		11. Final approach fix inbound (no radar)
		12. Radio or nav failures
		13. Compulsory reporting points (no radar)
		14. 500 FPM climb or descent unable. 
	3. Position reports^[Good read in [[IFR Magazine]] at [this link](https://www.ifr-magazine.com/technique/position-reports/)]
		1. [[designated reporting point]]s ([[FAR 91.183 IFR Communications]](a) and [[AIM 5]]-3-2)
		2. Position report structure ([[PTATEN]] mnemonic) ([[AIM 5]]-3-2(d))
			1. Position
			2. Time
			3. Altitude
			4. Type of flight plan (only required for reports to FSS…not to center or approach)
			5. Estimated time of arrival at the next reporting point
			6. Name of the reporting point after that
2. Clearances ([[Sample IFR Clearances]])
	1. When are clearances required? 
		1. [[FAR 91.173 ATC Clearance Reqd|FAR 91.173]]
		2. However, see Lamb 2016 LOI, which states operating IFR in uncontrolled airspace can be careless and reckless under [[FAR 91.13 Careless or Reckless Ops|91.13]], depending on the circumstances^[[Legal Interpretations](https://ifr-magazine.com/technique/legal-interpretations/) by [[IFR Magazine]]: "In a 1993 case, George Murphy was tired of waiting for his IFR release from a nontowered airport, so he took off uncontrolled [[IFR]] into low ceilings with passengers, figuring he would reach [[VMC]] before entering controlled airspace at 700 AGL. The violation for operating without a clearance was dismissed, but that did not stop the [[NTSB]] from giving him a 90-day flight vacation for careless and reckless operation."]
	2. How to obtain clearance
		1. Clearance Delivery/GND at Towered Airport
		2. FSS
		3. Approach/Departure Radio OR Phone
	3. [[CRAFT]] mnemonic^[[[ATC]] uses [[A Cold Squirrel Ran Around My Home And Froze]]]
		1. Clearance limit 
		2. Route 
		3. Altitude 
		4. Frequency 
		5. Transponder code 
	4. Tips on writing clearances
		1. Clearance shorthand ([[IFH]] Appendix A)
	5. “At Pilots Discretion” ([[AIM 4]]-4-10)
	6. [[VFR-On-Top]] ([[AIM 4]]-4-8)
	7. As Filed
	8. Departure Restrictions ([[AIM 5]]-2-7)
		1. Clearance void time (don’t exceed 30min)
		2. Hold for release 
		3. Release Time
		4. [[EDCT]] (depart no earlier than 5 min before and no later than 5 min after)
		5. Include runway in clearance request
		6. Good to mention use of [[ODP]] if unclear
	9. What if I don’t like the clearance? ([[AIM 4]]-4-4)
	10. Deviation - Emergency or [[TCAS]] alert
3. Request for delay vector or, similarly, request to continue holding
