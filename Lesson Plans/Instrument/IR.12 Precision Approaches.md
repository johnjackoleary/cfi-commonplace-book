### Objective
Develop proficiency in flying precision approaches, and demonstrate understanding of landing minimums and missed approach procedures 

### References
AIM Ch 5-4, IFH Ch 10, IPH Ch. 4, FAR 91.175 

### Builds On
- [[IR.6 Intercepting and Tracking VOR, HSI, Autopilot Usage]]
- [[IR.9 Airspace, Charts, Flight Planning and Enroute Operations]]
- [[IR.11 Communications, Clearances, Lost Communications Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours, flight 3 hours 

### Lesson Elements
1. Types of precision approaches 
	1. ILS 
	2. PAR 
	3. GPS LPV (technically, not precision approach, but included here because of similarity) 
2. Components of ILS: localizer, glide slope, outer marker (91.175)
	1. OM substitutions: Compass locator, PAR, ASR, DME, VOR, NDB, RNAV in conjunction with fix
	2. IM (used for CAT II and CAT III approaches)
3. Nav equipment considerations: 
	1. Use of GPS maps and guidance for initial approach (AC 90-108)
	2. Methods for switching CDI from GPS to VOR/LOC 
	3. CDI sensitivity changes during approach 
	4. Missed approach guidance – GPS guidance for missed approach 
4. At DA – what is required to descend below DA or MDA? (FAR 91.175) 
	1. Continuously in position to land, with normal descent rate and maneuvers 
	2. AND Flight visibility >= minimum 
	3. AND any one of:
		1. ALS (approach light system), although only to TDZE+100’
		2. Threshold, threshold markings, threshold lights
		3. Runway end identifier lights
		4. Runway, runway markings, runway lights
		5. Touchdown zone, touchdown zone markings, touchdown zone lights
		6. VGSI
	4. Threshold
5. When is a missed approach required? (FAR 91.175)
	1. At DA or MAP, if references above are not visible 
	2. If below MDA/DA, visibility < min OR lost view of airport references 
	3. During circling maneuver at or above MDA, airport not visible 
6. Missed approach 
	1. When to execute missed approach?
	2. Procedure: Cram, Climb, Cool, Configure, Call
	3. How to handle MA before MAP 
		1. Fly to MAP and 
	4. How to handle after MAP
		1. May choose to cancel IFR if conditions permit
		2. In ATC environment - immediately contact ATC to obtain amended clearance
		3. If unable to contact ATC, attempt to re-intercept published segment of missed approach
7. Common errors 
	1. Getting “behind” the airplane, not ready for missed approach, failing to accomplish checklist items 
	2. Overcontrolling during final phase of approach, with high CDI sensitivity 
	3. Using wrong navigation source during approach 
	4. Unstable approach, failure to configure for approach and landing 
	5. Descent below DA (slight dip is allowed)


### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate proficiency at flying precision approaches to ACS standards to landing, including circling approaches, and missed approach procedures. Maintain +-100’, +- 100 kts, +- 10°s, <3/4 CDI deflection.
