### Objective
Review instrument systems and diagnosis of instrument or system failures. To develop student knowledge and skill in partial panel attitude instrument flight (including instrument approaches), timed turns and magnetic compass turns.

### Resources
None

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ IR Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations]]
- [[IR.6 Unusual Attitude Recoveries, Including Partial Panel]]
- [[IR.9 Communications and Clearances]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, simulator and/or airplane 1 hour

### Lesson Elements
1. Review instrument systems and power sources 
	1. Vacuum pump drives A/I and HI (or HSI) 
	2. Electrical system drives T/C (turn coordinator) 
	3. Pitot-static system 
	4. Autopilot – rate based (uses turn coordinator) or attitude based?
2. Diagnosing system failures 
	1. Bank triangle (most critical): A/I, TC, Directional Gyro
	2. Pitch triangle: A/I, Altimeter, VSI (A/S, vacuum gauge) 
3. Partial Panel operations 
	1. Lost vacuum – no A/I or HI (HSI) 
		1. Use T/C and compass for bank, 
		2. Use VSI, altimeter, and A/S for pitch 
		3. Use of rate-based autopilot for no-gyro operation 
		4. Timed turns – 3°s per second at standard rate 
		5. Compass turns ([[UNOS]] mnemonic)
	2. Electrical failure – loss of T/C and rate-based autopilots 
		1. Use A/I and DG to replace turn coordinator 
		2. Bank angle for standard rate turn: 5 kts + airspeed/10 (120 knots gives requires 17°s bank angle) 
	3. Blocked pitot or static system, affecting A/S, VSI, altimeter 
		1. Alternate static source 
	4. G1000 partial panel operations: See Garmin guidance doc ([[IR.C Important References to Study]])
4. GPS Failure^[Tips for CFI on this in [[GPS Simulated Failure]]]
5. ATC notification 
	1. Can also always ask for a delay vector
6. No-gyro [[PAR]] approaches and [[ASR]] approaches 
7. [[Human Factors]], especially [[Vestibular and Visual Illusions]]
8. Common errors: 
	1. Slow to recognize failure could result in unusual attitude 
	2. Overcontrolling with partial panel 

### Completion Standards
Student must demonstrate understanding of instrument systems and ability to diagnose instrument and system failures. Student must become proficient in partial panel procedures, including enroute and instrument approaches (to be practiced frequently in future lessons).
