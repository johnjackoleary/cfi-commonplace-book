### Objective
Develop risk management and skills associated with ground reference maneuvers, including rectangular patterns, S-turns, and turns around a point.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section V.B

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[SOLO.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 2 hours flight

### CFI Equipment
GPS/Sentry/ADS-B In

### Lesson Elements
1. Effect of wind during ground reference maneuvers
	1. Effects of wind on ground track and crab angle![[Wind Drift.jpeg]]
	2. Effect of bank angle and groundspeed on rate and radius of turn (relative to ground)![[Effect of Wind on Turn.jpeg]]
2. Use [[Maneuvering Speed]]
	1. This speed changes with weight -- more weight raises maneuvering speed
3. Rate of turn and bank angle changes with ground speed -- more ground speed means more bank needed
4. Flying all maneuvers
	1. Select location without excessive traffic, and with suitable emergency landing fields
	2. Select altitude (600'-1000') and appropriate airspeed for maneuver
	3. Check for traffic in area before and between each maneuver
	4. Divide attention between airplane control, traffic, and ground references
	5. Be aware of low altitude hazards like wires
5. Maneuver Specific
	1. Rectangular Course![[Rectangular Course.jpeg]]
		1. Select suitable reference
		2. Enter 45° to the downwind leg, left or right traffic
		3. Aim for 1/4-1/2 mile from reference, account for wind
		4. Turn crosswind from downwind when you are abeam the crosswind reference line
		5. This maneuver simulates flying the traffic pattern
	2. Turns Around a Point![[Turns Around a Point.jpeg]]
		1. Select suitable reference
		3. Enter downwind, 1/4-1/2mi from reference
		4. Tailwind: Steeper bank; Headwind: Shallower bank
		5. Use 4 points along circle to help maintain constant radius
	3. S-Turns![[S-Turns.jpeg]]
		1. Select suitable reference, perpendicular to wind
		2. Enter downwind
		4. Tailwind: Steeper bank; Headwind: Shallower bank
		3. Use 5 points on S-turn to help maintain constant radius
		4. Wings level and parallel to reference as you cross
6. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to check for traffic or to locate emergency field
	2. Failure to divide attention aircraft control, instrument check, ground references, traffic and situational awareness
	3. Improper correction for wind drift
	4. Lack of rudder coordination
	5. Failure to maintain altitude or airspeed throughout the maneuver

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate location, select a safe entry speed, and perform the maneuvers to ACS standards. Tolerances: ±100 feet, ±10 knots.
