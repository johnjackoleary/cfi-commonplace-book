### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with emergency landings, including choosing an emergency landing location and considerations for a survivable landing.

### Resources
- [[AFM]]/[[POH]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section IX.B

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL3.2 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]]
- [[PPL3.3 Forward Slips and No Flap Landings]]

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 2 hour flight, frequent practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority]]:
	1. > [!cite] In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to the extent required to meet that emergency.
2. Types of emergency landings: forced landing, precautionary landing, ditching
3. [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]]
4. [[ABCDE]]
5. Details on flying the approach
	1. Effects of headwinds/tailwinds 
		1. ![[Effect of Headwind on Landing Point.jpeg]]
	2. Aircraft configuration, such as gear and flaps ![[Flaps Effect on Landing Point.jpeg]]
	3. Keep altitude, and plan to use [[PPL3.3 Forward Slips and No Flap Landings|forward slip]] to control touchdown location
	4. Don't try to stretch a glide! ![[Stretching a Glide.jpeg]]
	5. Securing fuel and electrical systems before landing
	6. Unlatch doors before touchdown
	7. Maintain aircraft control all the way through the landing -- a controlled landing in bad terrain is better than an uncontrolled landing in good terrain ([[Fly Into The Crash In A Forced Landing]])
6. Considerations for safe landing
	1. Protect the cabin: Can keep the aircraft cabin in tact by using dispensable structures (wings, landing gear, etc)
	2. Protect the passengers: Make sure seatbelts are on and secure
	3. Remove energy slowly on landing: look for ways to absorb energy during landing (field of corn, brush), and reduce groundspeed as much as possible
		1. Trying to minimize peak deceleration in controlled crash -- spread out the energy loss
	4. Consider landing near road infrastructure given the option, for easier search and rescue
7. Notes on best terrain selection
	1. Roads are tempting options, especially at night, but most large roads carry a risk of manmade structures like electrical wires that will be hard to see from far away. Plus, there's traffic on the road -- it may not be your best option.
	2. Read through additional comments from [[FAA]] in [[AFH Ch18]]
	3. [Emergency Landing: Beach or Breakers?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LwGYBBhTss) from [[Paul Bertorelli]] of [[AVweb]]
	4. [How to Crash Land An Airplane On A Freeway With Style and Grace And Survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99DomTe9JY4) from [[Paul Bertorelli]] of [[AVweb]]
8. Considerations for ditching
	1. High Winds, Heavy Seas - INTO THE WIND 
	2. Light Winds, Heavy Swells - PARALLEL TO SWELLS
9. Psychological Hazards
	1. Not accepting situation - wasting altitude instead of immediately starting on [[ABCDE]]
	2. Desire to save airplane - if the engine quits, it's the insurance company's plane now. Your job is to execute a survivable landing, and sacrificing the aircraft for the safety of the passengers may be the best thing to do
10. Practicing Today
	1. Emergency procedures in flight
	2. Flying to land from key point
	3. "Short approach" request meaning and use in traffic pattern
11. Common Errors
	1. Aviate first! Don't let distractions lead to loss of control.
	2. Route of flight with few or no landing options
	3. Lack of situational awareness. Be aware of positions and options.
	4. Failure to use checklist

### Completion Standards
Client should develop knowledge of emergencies and procedures, and demonstrate the ability to maneuver and land the airplane, while following checklist procedures including emergency communications.
