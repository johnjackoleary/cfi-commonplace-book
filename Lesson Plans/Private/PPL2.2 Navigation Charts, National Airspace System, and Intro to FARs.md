### Introduction
We live in one of the most complicated airspaces in the nation.  Just getting in and out of PAO requires a solid understanding of airspaces.  But good news: once you know how to fly here, you can fly anywhere.

Airspaces also really matter for trip-planning, where you're be required to know what permissions you need to traverse each airspace, and which ones to avoid.

This lesson starts by looking at the six main types of airspace, specifically
- Who is allowed into each one
- Equipment requirements for each one, and
- VFR visibility requirements for each one

Then we'll take a look at VFR charts and chart supplements to see what information we can learn from them. Finally, we'll cover Special Use Airspace (SUA), Special Flight Rules Areas (SFRA), and Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR).

This lesson is a long one, because there are a lot of details to cover. But understanding each line and symbol on the VFR charts will give you the confidence to fly here, and anywhere.

4. Talk through airspace involved in KPAO-VPMIN
	1. At 3500' and 1000'
	2. During day and night
