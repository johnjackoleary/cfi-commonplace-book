### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with pilotage navigation by reference to charts, and dead reckoning navigation with reference to clock and compass, including expected wind correction.

### Resources
N/A

### Builds On
[[PPL.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.0, Flight â€“ multiple during dual cross-country flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]].

### CFI Equipment
E6-B

### Lesson Elements
1. Pilotage
	1. Reading charts, and navigating by visual landmarks
	2. Following flight plans
2. Dead reckoning
	1. Navigation by direction, airspeed, distance and time
	2. Flight log forms, and updating during flight
	3. Mental arithmetic - time, speed, distance

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to fly a cross country route, using dead reckoning and pilotage, visually identifying each waypoint, and recording actual time of arrival. Client should be able to update the navigation plan in-flight to account for variations in heading and groundspeed due to unforecasted winds.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Use of aeronautical charts for VFR navigation using pilotage and dead reckoning with the aid of a magnetic compass
- Recognition, avoidance, and operational restrictions of hazardous terrain features in the geographical area where the cross-country flight will be flown

### Required Homework
- [ ] Plan flight to Kingdon Airpark (O20), or other airport >=51nm away^[This distanace makes the flight count as cross-country, which requires a straightline distance of at least 50nm. We'll use 51nm minimum, to make the checkride smoother, but in your own flights >=50nm can count as cross-country.]

### Recommended Homework
None
