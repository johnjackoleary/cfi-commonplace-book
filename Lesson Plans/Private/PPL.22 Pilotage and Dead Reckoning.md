### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with pilotage navigation by reference to charts, and dead reckoning navigation with reference to clock and compass, including expected wind correction.

### Resources
N/A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]
- [[PPL.20 Flight Planning including Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.0, Flight â€“ multiple during dual cross-country flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]].

### CFI Equipment
[[E6B]]

### Lesson Elements
1. [[Pilotage]]
	1. Reading charts and navigating by visual landmarks
	2. Following flight plans
	3. When do we use this in practice?
2. [[Dead Reckoning]]
	1. Navigation by direction, airspeed, distance and time
	2. Flight log forms, and updating during flight
	3. Mental arithmetic - time, speed, distance
	4. When do we use this in practice?

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to fly a cross country route, using dead reckoning and pilotage, visually identifying each waypoint, and recording actual time of arrival. Client should be able to update the navigation plan in-flight to account for variations in heading and groundspeed due to unforecasted winds.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Use of aeronautical charts for VFR navigation using pilotage and dead reckoning with the aid of a magnetic compass

### Required Homework
