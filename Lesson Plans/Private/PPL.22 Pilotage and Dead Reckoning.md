### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with pilotage navigation by reference to charts, and dead reckoning navigation with reference to clock and compass, including expected wind correction.  Learn to complete a full navlog for a cross-country flight, including headings, waypoints, altitudes, and fuel requirements.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section VI.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[SOLO.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]
- [[PPL.20 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours, Flight – multiple during dual cross-country flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]].

### CFI Equipment
- [[E6B]] Calculator or App

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons PPL [[PPL.18 Non-Towered Airport Operations|18]], [[PPL.19 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|19]], [[PPL.20 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|20]], [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|21]], & [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|22]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. [[Pilotage]]
	1. Reading charts and navigating by visual landmarks
	2. Following flight plans
	3. When do we use this in practice?
2. [[Dead Reckoning]]
	1. Navigation by direction, airspeed, distance and time
	2. Flight log forms, and updating during flight
	3. Mental arithmetic - time, speed, distance
	4. When do we use this in practice?
3. [[Compass Errors]]
	1. Navigating by Pilotage and Dead Reckoning requires awareness of the in-flight compass errors (Acceleration and Turning errors)
4. Completing a full navlog
	1. How to handle step climbs under a Bravo

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to:
- Complete a navlog and fly a cross country route, using dead reckoning and pilotage, visually identifying each waypoint, and recording actual time of arrival
- Arrive at checkpoints within 3NM and within 5 minutes of initial or revised estimate
- Maintain appropriate altitude ±200' and heading ±15°
- Update the navigation plan in-flight to account for variations in heading and groundspeed due to unforecasted winds.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Use of aeronautical charts for VFR navigation using pilotage and dead reckoning with the aid of a magnetic compass

### Required Homework
- [ ] Complete a full navlog from Palo Alto to a destination assigned by the instructor.

### Recommended Homework
None
