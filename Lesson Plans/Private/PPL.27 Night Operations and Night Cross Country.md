### Objective
Develop knowledge and skill pertaining to night flight.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section XI.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]
- [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, flight 3 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Regulations pertaining to night flight
	1. Required equipment ([[FAR 91.205 Instrument and Equipment Requirements]]) - [[APES]] or [[FLAPS]]
	2. Navigation lights required sunsetâ€”sunrise ([[FAR 91.209 Aircraft Lights]])
	3. Logging night flight -- after civil twilight ([[Night - For Logging Time]])
	4. Night currency for carrying passengers -- 3 takeoffs and (fullstop) landings within 90 days, >1 hour after sunset
2. Aircraft lighting and Night Equipment
	1. Anti-collision lights -- strobes and/or beacon
	3. Navigation lights
	4. Landing Lights
		1. > [!quote] From [[AFH Ch11]]
		> Pilots are encouraged to turn on their landing lights when operating within 10 miles of an airport and below 10,000 feet.
	5. Interior and panel lighting
4. Airport lighting
	1. Beacons, runway and taxi lighting, VASI, PAPI, REIL
	2. Pilot controlled lighting and how to operate
5. Navigation at night
	1. Pilotage and chart-reading techniques
	2. Illusion affecting night flight
		1. [[False Horizon]]
		2. [[Autokinesis]]
		3. [[Black-Hole Approach]]
			1. Importance of [[VASI]] or [[PAPI]] lights
6. Pilot considerations
	1. Physiology of night flight with respect to vision
	2. Personal lighting equipment
7. Night flight experience -- 3 hours required:
	1. Dual cross-country of > 100nm
	2. 10 takeoffs and landings in pattern, full stop^[Notice both takeoff and landings must be at night. If you depart before/during civil twilight and land after civil twilight, that counts as 1 night landing, but not 1 night takeoff.]^[These 10 takeoffs and landings must also be around the pattern, not just the end of a flight.]
8. Common errors
	1. Navigational disorientation
	2. Loss of situational awareness, due to loss of visual horizon
	3. Getting low on final approach, due to black hole illusion
	4. Inadvertent flight into clouds is possible

### Completion Standards
Client demonstrates the knowledge and skills to safely fly and navigate at night.
