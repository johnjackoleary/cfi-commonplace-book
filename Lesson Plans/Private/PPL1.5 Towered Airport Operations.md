### Objective
Operating out of any airport, towered or untowered, requires an understanding of airport signage, standard taxi and pattern procedures, radio comms, and often some local knowledge you'll learn from a local. Since we're training out of towered airports, we cover those operations here, and will cover untowered operations in [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations|PPL4.2]].  New pilots often find towered airports more intimidating, because you have to talk to ATC. But once you learn the basics, you'll find that most radio work is following standard patterns. To make progress, learn the patterns so you know what to expect.  Then the information will be easier to catch, and anything unusual will stand out immediately.

**Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework:** [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]
**Schedule: 3 hours ground**

### Lesson Elements
1. Airport Signs and Markings
	1. Most are described in [[AIM 2]], section 3
	2. Flashcards from [[AOPA]] ([slideshow](https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/aopa/runwaysafetyflashcard/index.php#/p/1) or [cards](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/FIles/AOPA/Home/Online-Education/Flash-Cards/RWcards_lo.pdf))
2. Radio communications
	1. [[Phonetic Alphabet]]
		1. Memorize them! Alpha through Zulu^[I once heard a pilot trying to give his tail number to ATC, saying "one two three tee vee, as in television." So embarrassing]
		2. Special number pronunciations: "Tree", "Fife" and "Niner"
		3. You can practice by reading license plates out loud as you drive
	2. Memorize frequencies for training airport ([[Bay Area Radio Frequencies]])
	3. Format for all initial radio calls: YOU (who you're calling), ME (who you are), WHERE you are (in 3D space), WHAT you want
	4. Format for responses:
		1. If in doubt, read back full instructions, followed by your call sign
		2. You can read back only the key data, but some elements must always be read back:
			1. Runway #, taxing instructions, hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared-for-takeoff, cleared-to-land, etc.
			2. Sometimes specific request for readback in the [[ATIS]]
	5. After tuning a frequency, PAUSE before talking to make sure you're not stepping on a conversation (counting to 4 seems to be the magic duration)
	6. Mentally rehearse what you will say before keying the mic.
	7. If in doubt, ask for clarification or request "say again" (or "say again *\<element\>*")
	8. Don't be afraid to throw in a "student pilot", to get a little extra understanding
	9. Anticipate the response and pay attention for any unusual elements
	10. Don't abbreviate your call sign until ATC does
3. Radio communications practice (ATC phraseology):
	1. [[Tower Radio Communication Examples]]
	2. Standard Phraseology in [[AIM 4-2]]
	3. Few you may hear
		1. Roger - I understand (although typically you will just say your N-number instead)
		2. Wilco - I understand and will comply (when a readback is not needed)
		3. Affirm(ative) / Negative - Yes / No
		4. (Negative) Contact - I (do not) have the aircraft in sight
		5. Say Again (*\<element\>*") - Please repeat (*specific info*, e.g. altitude)
		6. Standby - Please wait, and there's no need to acknowledge this standby
		7. Unable, *reason* - I cannot do that request because of *reason*
	4. Handling traffic advisories: negative contact, looking, or traffic in sight
	5. [[FAR 91.123 Compliance with ATC]]
4. Taxiing Procedure
	1. Receiving and recording [[ATIS]]
	2. Airport and taxiway familiarization - Have your taxi diagram out when taxiing
	3. Taxi instructions/clearances
	4. [[Runway Incursion]]
5. Takeoff clearances: hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared for takeoff
6. Departure and Arrival Procedures and Communication at Home Airport
	1. Listen to LiveATC for local radio calls
7. Radio Issues
	1. Stuck microphones -- how to detect, how to respond
		1. Detection: You're not hearing them, or they don't seem to be hearing you
		2. Look for "Tx" on the G1000, or the Tx LED on the radio
		3. Examine the PPT button-- is it stuck?
		4. Try tuning the problematic radio to an unused frequency, and using the other radio
		5. If all else fails, squawk 7600 and decide whether to continue or terminate
	2. [[Light Gun Signals]]
		1. Example
			1. > [!youtube] Published by [FLY8MA.com Flight Training](https://www.youtube.com/@fly8ma.comflighttraining199) 
			   > ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxoakUa8UqQ)
		2. Debugging common radio issues (volume low, cable disconnect)
		3. Study and memorize the signals
		4. Put a copy onto your kneeboard (people forget in the stress of the moment!)
9. Common Errors
	1. Poor radio etiquette, stepping on others, getting tongue-tied
	2. Not reading back the required information
	3. Not [[scanning for traffic]], or keeping traffic to follow in sight

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate good radio communications and etiquette as specified in the AIM, understand the training airport ground environment, and how to use light signals in case of radio/electrical failure.

### Resources
- [[AIM 2]]
- Handouts for [[KPAO Airport Diagram.pdf|KPAO taxiways]], [[KPAO Chart Supplement.pdf|Chart Supplements page]], [[Tower Radio Communication Examples|common radio calls]], and [[Light Gun Signals]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section III.A

### Required Logbook Phraseology
[[FAR 61.87 Student Solo Reqs]]: 
- (d)(6) Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures

[[FAR 61.105 PPL Knowledge Reqs]]:
- (b)(5) Radio communication procedures

[[FAR 61.107 PPL Flight Reqs]]:
- (b)(1)(iii) Airport and seaplane base operations

### Required Homework
- [ ] Memorize [[Phonetic Alphabet]] -- consider singing the alphabet while washing hands, or practicing license plates on drive
- [ ] Memorize training airport frequencies
- [ ] Print light gun signals for kneeboard

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Listen to www.liveatc.net tower + ground for training airport
- [ ] Consider [Radio Communications Made Easy](https://pilotinstitute.com/course/radio-communications/) from [[Pilot Institute]]
- [ ] Consider [Pilot Edge](https://pilotedge.net) in a #sim, if looking for realistic practice^[Example of Pilot Edge [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2G-mwXZkfA). Jack has heard really good reports from folks who use it.]
