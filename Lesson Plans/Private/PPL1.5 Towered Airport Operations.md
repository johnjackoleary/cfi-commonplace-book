### Objective
Understand airport operations, including communications, traffic patterns, and light gun signals.

### Resources
- [[AIM 2]]
- Handouts for [[KPAO Airport Diagram.pdf|KPAO taxiways]], [[KPAO Chart Supplement.pdf|Chart Supplements page]], [[Tower Radio Communication Examples|common radio calls]], and [[Light Gun Signals]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section III.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
3 hours ground

### Lesson Elements
1. Airport Features
	2. Signs and Markings
	3. Flashcards from [[AOPA]] ([slideshow](https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/aopa/runwaysafetyflashcard/index.php#/p/1) or [cards](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/FIles/AOPA/Home/Online-Education/Flash-Cards/RWcards_lo.pdf))
2. Radio communications
	1. [[Phonetic Alphabet]]
		1. Memorize them! Alpha through Zulu
		2. Special number pronunciations: "Tree" and "Niner"
	2. Memorize frequencies for training airport ([[Bay Area Radio Frequencies]])
	3. Format for all radio calls: YOU (who you're calling), ME (who you are), WHERE you are (in 3D space), WHAT you want
	4. Required readbacks:
		1. Runway #, taxing instructions, hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared-for-takeoff, cleared-to-land, etc.
		2. Sometimes specific request for readback in the ATIS
		3. If in doubt, readback full instructions
	5. After tuning a frequency, PAUSE before talking to make sure you're not stepping on a conversation (counting to 4 seems to be the magic duration)
	6. Mentally rehearse what you will say before keying the mic.
	7. If in doubt, ask for clarification or request "say again"
	8. Anticipate the response and pay attention for any unusual elements
	9. Stuck microphones -- how to detect, how to respond
4.  Taxiing Procedure
	1. Receiving and recording [[ATIS]]
	2. Airport and taxiway familiarization
	3. Taxi instructions/clearances
	4. [[Runway Incursion]]
6. Takeoff clearances: hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared for takeoff
7. Radio communications practice (ATC phraseology):
	1. [[Tower Radio Communication Examples]]
	2. Standard Phraseology in [[AIM 4-2]]
	3. Few you may hear
		1. Roger - I understand (although typically you will just say your N-number instead)
		2. Wilco - I understand and will comply (when a readback is not needed)
		3. Affirmative / Negative - Yes / No
		4. (Negative) Contact - I (do not) have the aircraft in sight
		5. Say Again - Please repeat
		6. Standby - Please wait, and there's no need to acknowledge this standby
		7. Unable, *reason* - I cannot do that request because of *reason*
	4. [[FAR 91.123 Compliance with ATC]]
8. [[Light Gun Signals]]
	1. Example
		1. <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxoakUa8UqQ"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
		2. From *[Real Light Gun Signals | ATC Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxoakUa8UqQ)* by [FLY8MA.com Flight Training](https://www.youtube.com/@fly8ma.comflighttraining199)
	2. Debugging common radio issues (volume low, cable disconnect)
	3. Study and memorize the signals
	4. Put a copy onto your kneeboard (people forget in the stress of the moment!)
9. Departure and Arrival Procedures and Communication at Home Airport
	1. #todo :: clean up ordering of lesson
10. Common Errors
	1. Poor radio etiquette, stepping on others, getting tongue-tied
	2. Not reading back the required information
	3. Not scanning for traffic, or keeping traffic to follow in sight

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate good radio communications and etiquette as specified in the AIM, understand the training airport ground environment, and how to use light signals in case of radio/electrical failure.
