### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with pilotage navigation by reference to charts, and dead reckoning navigation with reference to clock and compass, including expected wind correction.  Learn to complete a full navlog for a cross-country flight, including headings, waypoints, altitudes, and fuel requirements.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section VI.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts, National Airspace System, and Intro to FARs]]
- [[PPL4.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours, Flight – multiple during dual cross-country flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]].

### CFI Equipment
- [[E6B]] Calculator or App

1. [[Pilotage]]
	1. Reading charts and navigating by visual landmarks
	2. Following flight plans
	3. When do we use this in practice?
2. [[Dead Reckoning]]
	1. Navigation by direction, airspeed, distance and time
	2. Flight log forms, and updating during flight
	3. Mental arithmetic - time, speed, distance
	4. When do we use this in practice?
3. [[Compass Errors]]
	1. Navigating by Pilotage and Dead Reckoning requires awareness of the in-flight compass errors (Acceleration and Turning errors)
	2. How the Heading Indicator mitigates these errors
4. Completing a full navlog
	1. How to handle step climbs under a Bravo
5. Other Flight Planners / Navigation Logs are available
	1. Done by hand
		1. Consider [ASA](https://asa2fly.com/flight-planner-pad/) or [Jeppesen](https://www.amazon.com/Jeppesen-VFR-Navigation-Log-JS436183/dp/B003VSCCJ0/ref=sr_1_36?keywords=JEPPESEN&qid=1703037416&sr=8-36)
		2. Print a comparable one online in [horizontal](https://www.dauntless-soft.com/products/Freebies/VFRFlightPlanner/)^[Version B seems to align best with flow from [[E6B]] instructions] or [vertical](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/za5mbd/comment/iykckje/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
		3. [EntireFlight VFR XC Flight Pad](https://www.entireflight.com/collections/flight-pads)
	2. Done electronically
		1. [Calculator with manual input](https://e6bx.com/navlog/)
		2. Generated with info like forecasted winds from [[ForeFlight]], [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/), or others

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to complete a navlog and fly a cross country route, using dead reckoning and pilotage, visually identifying each waypoint, and recording actual time of arrival

> [!success]- Tolerances (Partial) from [[Private Pilot ACS|ACS]]
> - Arrive at checkpoints within 3NM and within 5 minutes of initial or revised estimate
> - Maintain appropriate altitude ±200' and heading ±15°
> - Update the navigation plan in-flight to account for variations in heading and groundspeed due to unforecasted winds.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
[[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- (e)(1) Use of aeronautical charts for VFR navigation using pilotage and dead reckoning with the aid of a magnetic compass

### Required Homework
- [ ] Complete a full navlog from Palo Alto to a destination assigned by the instructor.
- [ ] Memorize compass error acronyms: [[ANDS]], [[UNOS]], [[NOSE]]

### Recommended Homework
None
