## Performance Maneuvers - Steep Turns

**Objective:** Develop knowledge of the aerodynamics of steep turns, including load factor and effect on stall speed. Develop risk management and skills associated with steep turns.
**References:** ACS Sec V-A, AFH Ch 9
**Builds On:** [[Four Fundamentals of Flight]]
**Schedule:** Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 1.0 hours
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Aerodynamics of steep turns
	1. Adverse yaw and rudder usage to compensate for it
	2. Rudder usage during turn entry, steady turn, and turn exit
	3. Over-banking tendency -- possibly causing crossed controls during turn
	4. Load factor (g force) varies with bank angle (reciprocal of cosine of bank angle)
	5. Stall speed varies with square root of load factor![[Bank Versus Stall Speed and Load Factor]]
	7. Most light aircraft designed for 3.8 positive g max (corresponds to 75-degree bank level turn)
	8. Maneuvering speed Va - define and discuss entry speed for steep turn
2. Flying the maneuver
	1. Select area free of traffic and with emergency landing options
	2. Clear area and check for traffic (high wing plane - lift wing slightly before banking)
	3. Configure for speed <= Va, fast enough to avoid stall at 60 degree bank ($1.4*$Vs)
	4. Establish turn with 45 degree bank, add power as necessary to maintain airspeed
	5. Use of rudder to initiate, maintain, and exit turn (cancel out adverse yaw)
	6. Use of elevator aft pressure to maintain altitude &plusmn;100 feet (don't trim during turn)
	7. use outside reference of horizon to maintain bank and pitch, with occasional cross-check of altitude and airspeed
	8. May notice (subtle) opposite aileron during turn to prevent over-banking tendency
	9. Roll out of turn on entry heading &plusmn;10 degrees
	10. Release back pressure and reduce power during rollout
3. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to scan for traffic or locating emergency field
	2. Using airspeed greater than Va
	3. Letting altitude or bank angle drift during turn
	4. Lack of rudder coordination
	5. Not adding power to maintain airspeed
	6. Rolling out on wrong heading

**Completion Standards:** Client must demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate location, select a safe entry speed, perform 360-degree turn in either direction with 45-degree bank, maintaining altitude and adding power to maintain airspeed. Tolerances: &plusmn;100 feet, &plusmn;10 knots, &plusmn;5 degrees bank, &plusmn;10 degrees heading on rollout.

**Required Homework:** None
**Recommended Homework:**
