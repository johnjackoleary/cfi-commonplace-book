### Objective
Develop knowledge and ability to plot a course, then use onboard navigation equipment to follow it. Additionally, develop knowledge of [[ATC]] capabilities and ability to use ATC assistance with radar vectors.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section VI.B
- Manuals for all installed equipment in the plane

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[SOLO.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hours, 1 hour sim

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons PPL [[XC.2 Non-Towered Airport Operations|18]], [[XC.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|19]], [[XC.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|20]], [[XC.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|21]], & [[XC.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|22]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. Planning a cross-country flight
	1. Charting a [[Course]]: [[Sectional Chart with Checkpoints.jpeg]]
		1. Considerations for hazards and airspace along the course
	2. Choosing checkpoints
	3. Choosing altitude
	4. Day-of considerations
		1. Winds aloft may favor different course/altitude
		2. Clouds, ice, turbulence, etc may influence course/altitude
2. Compass and [[Compass Errors]]^[Especially relevant to [[XC.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]]
3. Radio navigation equipment
	1. [[Ground-Based Navigation using VOR, DME, and ILS]]
	2. [[Satellite Navigation using GPS and GNSS]]
	3. Images of [various antennas on the aircraft](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/students/presolo/special/antennas) from [[AOPA]]
4. [[Transponder]]s, and altitude reporting equipment
	1. [[ADS-B]]
5. Autopilot
	1. preflight
	2. single/dual axis
6. ATC services and assistance available
	1. Flight following (and [[Flight Following Radio Communication Examples]])
	2. Airport Surveillance Radar ([[ASR]])

### Completion Standards
Client should develop knowledge of navigation equipment on board their training aircraft. Client should be familiar with services available from ATC, and know how and when to request assistance.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Procedures for operating the instruments and equipment installed in the aircraft to be flown, including recognition and use of the proper operational procedures and indications
- Recognition, avoidance, and operational restrictions of hazardous terrain features in the geographical area where the cross-country flight will be flown

### Required Homework
- [ ] Memorize compass error acronyms: [[ANDS]], [[UNOS]], [[NOSE]]

### Recommended Homework
None
