### Objective
Develop knowledge of towered airport traffic patterns, skill and judgement in approaching and departing various types of patterns, and good procedures while flying the pattern. Additionally develop knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with go-around or rejected landing, with emphasis on landing conditions that may require a go-around.

### Lesson Elements
#### Traffic Pattern
1. General traffic pattern principles
	1. [[Left Traffic Pattern.jpeg]]
	2. Five named legs
	3. Distances around traffic pattern
		1. Downwind is 1/2 to 1 mile out
		2. Turn base at approximately 45° to the approach end of runway
	4. Left traffic (meaning making left turns) unless otherwise noted
	5. Emphasis on the word 'pattern'
2. As you approach an airport to land, what information do you need?
	1. Which runway to use?
		1. Which runway is best for the current wind?  Which is the "calm wind" runway?
		2. Does the ATIS specify a different runway in use?
		3. Are there planes in the pattern (you probably need to use the same runway they are)
	2. Runway length
	3. Right or left traffic?  Left is the default.
	4. Pattern altitude?  1000' AGL is the default.
	5. (I generally sketch a diagram with all this info on my kneepad)
3. Finding the information you need
	1. Entry procedures and pattern information
		1. Sectionals
		2. Chart Supplements (A/FD)
		3. ForeFlight
		4. Airport website for noise abatement or other procedures
	2. Wind and weather: ATIS / ForeFlight
4. Common ATC instructions to expect and understand
	1. "Make right traffic"
	2. "Enter right midfield"
	3. "Enter right base"
	4. "I'll call your base"
	5. "Make a left 360 for spacing"
	6. "Number 3 behind a Cessna turning right base; Cleared to land runway 27"
5. Common terms you'll use to describe your own location on the radio:
	1. "On the right 45"
	2. "Right downwind"
	3. "Right base"
	4. "Final"
	5. "Short Final"
	6. "On the go"
	7. "Upwind" / "Departure"
	8. "Right crosswind"
	9. "Departing straight out"
	10. "Departing right crosswind"
	11. "Departing right downwind"
	12. "Landing straight in on runway 27" (only if no one else is in the pattern, and even then be careful)
6. At an un-towered airport, the default is to enter on the 45.  What if that's not the direction you're coming from?
	1. Circle wide
	2. Cross midfield above the pattern, and cloverleaf onto the 45
	3. More in [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations]]
7. Flying the pattern
	1. Memorize power settings/airspeeds, use wind correction angle like the [[PPL2.5 Ground Reference Maneuvers|rectangular course]] ![[Rectangular Course.jpeg]]
	2. Should do a [[GUMPS]] check on downwind, and may consider a [[Final Check When Turning Final]]
	3. Power, Airspeed, and Config for your aircraft in [[Aircraft Gait Charts]]^[If you're unsure what power settings to use, consider this [[Tip on Choosing Pattern Speeds]]]
	4. Descending when tower delays base turn
8. Palo Alto specifics worth knowing
	1. Pattern altitude: 800' on east side, 1000' on west side
	2. Entering Pattern
		1. Visual Reporting points for calling in to KPAO: SLAC, Woodside VOR, Windy Hill, Leslie Salt, Coyote Hills, Sunol Pass, etc....
		2. Approaching from west: maintain 1500' until crossing 101 freeway
		3. Typically enter on 45° downwind, unless told otherwise by tower
	3. Leaving the Pattern
		1. Common departures: Left and Right Dumbarton, 270 overhead
	4. Noise Abatement
		1. Standard Right Traffic for runway 31, turn right 10 degrees after departure for noise abatement
9. Common Errors
	1. Lack of planning ahead, staying ahead of the airplane
	2. Lack of situation awareness or awareness of other traffic
	3. Improper radio usage, forgetting radio calls at non-towered airports


#### Go-Arounds
1. Situations requiring a go-around
	1. Be prepared constantly for go-around. Every landing is a potential go-around! Go-around sooner, rather than later. Don't let things get out of hand!
	2. Too high to land in first third of runway
	3. Traffic on runway, or instruction from tower to go-around
	4. Unstable final approach
	5. Possibility of wake turbulence
	6. Wind shear or gusty crosswind
	7. Bounced landing, or ballooning during flare
2. Go-around procedure ([[5 C's (Going Missed)]] or [[Power, Pedal, Pitch]] or [[Power Up, Pitch Up, Clean Up]])
	1. [[Go-Around Procedure.jpeg]]
	2. Stop the Descent (Cram)
		1. Full power (throttle and prop), smooth but rapid, carb heat off
		2. Right rudder
		3. Be prepared to resist nose-up tendency
		4. Raise flaps one notch
		5. Accelerate to Vx
	3. Climb
		1. Pitch to Vx or Vy climb attitude by visual reference to horizon
		2. Trim for Vx or Vy
		3. Move off centerline, if another aircraft on runway
	4. Cool
		1. depends on aircraft
	5. Configure
		1. Verify positive rate of climb, incrementally set flaps for normal climb
	6. Call
		1. Report go-around to tower ([[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate|Aviate, Navigate, then Communicate]]), if needed
	7. Use take-off check-list
4. Common Errors
	1. Initiating go-around too late
	2. Too slow power application, leaving carb heat on
	3. Improper pitch attitude, causing touch down or porpoise
	4. Lack of rudder usage to correct for P-factor and torque
	5. Drifting from runway centerline (unless offsetting for conflicting traffic)
	6. Forgetting checklist items (flaps, carb heat, cowl flaps)
	7. Expecting CFI to fix a risky landing attempt (may not be possible!)
