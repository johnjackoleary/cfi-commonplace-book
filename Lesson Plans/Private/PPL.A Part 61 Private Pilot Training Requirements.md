**Solo Requirements for Student Pilots:**
From [[FAR 61.87 Student Solo Reqs]] (d) *Maneuvers and procedures for pre-solo flight training in a single engine airplane.*

A student pilot who is receiving training for a single-engine airplane rating or privileges must receive and log flight training for the following maneuvers and procedures:
- [ ] Proper flight preparation procedures, including preflight planning and preparation, powerplant operation, and aircraft systems;
- [ ] Taxiing or surface operations, including runups;
- [ ] Takeoffs and landings, including normal and crosswind;
- [ ] Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions;
- [ ] Climbs and climbing turns;
- [ ] Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures;
- [ ] Collision avoidance, wind shear avoidance, and wake turbulence avoidance;
- [ ] Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations;
- [ ] Flight at various airspeeds from cruise to slow flight;
- [ ] Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall;
- [ ] Emergency procedures and equipment malfunctions;
- [ ] Ground reference maneuvers;
- [ ] Approaches to a landing area with simulated engine malfunctions;
- [ ] Slips to a landing; and
- [ ] Go-arounds.


**Solo Cross-Country Requirements for Student Pilots:**
From [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]] (e) *Maneuvers and procedures for cross-country flight training in a single-engine airplane.*

A student pilot who is receiving training for cross-country flight in a single-engine airplane must receive and log flight training in the following maneuvers and procedures:
- [ ] Use of aeronautical charts for VFR navigation using pilotage and dead reckoning with the aid of a magnetic compass;
- [ ] Use of aircraft performance charts pertaining to cross-country flight;
- [ ] Procurement and analysis of aeronautical weather reports and forecasts, including recognition of critical weather situations and estimating visibility while in flight;
- [ ] Emergency procedures;
- [ ] Traffic pattern procedures that include area departure, area arrival, entry into the traffic pattern, and approach;
- [ ] Procedures and operating practices for collision avoidance, wake turbulence precautions, and wind shear avoidance;
- [ ] Recognition, avoidance, and operational restrictions of hazardous terrain features in the geographical area where the cross-country flight will be flown;
- [ ] Procedures for operating the instruments and equipment installed in the aircraft to be flown, including recognition and use of the proper operational procedures and indications;
- [ ] Use of radios for VFR navigation and two-way communication, except that a student pilot seeking a sport pilot certificate must only receive and log flight training on the use of radios installed in the aircraft to be flown;
- [ ] Takeoff, approach, and landing procedures, including short-field, soft-field, and crosswind takeoffs, approaches, and landings;
- [ ] Climbs at best angle and best rate; and
- [ ] Control and maneuvering solely by reference to flight instruments, including straight and level flight, turns, descents, climbs, use of radio aids, and ATC directives. For student pilots seeking a sport pilot certificate, the provisions of this paragraph only apply when receiving training for cross-country flight in an airplane that has a VH greater than 87 knots CAS.
