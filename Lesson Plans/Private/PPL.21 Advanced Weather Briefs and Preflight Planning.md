### Objective
Develop ability to obtain, process and understand pre-flight weather briefings, and use weather data. Understand services and process intended to help identify risks and make better decisions.

### Resources
- [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
- [[AC 91-92]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
1 hour ground, practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]].
