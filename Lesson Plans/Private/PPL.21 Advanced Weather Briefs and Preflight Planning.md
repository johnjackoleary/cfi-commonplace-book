### Objective
Develop ability to obtain, process and understand pre-flight weather briefings, and use weather data. Understand services and process intended to help identify risks and make better decisions.

### Resources
- [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
- [[AC 91-92]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hour, practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]].

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons PPL [[PPL.18 Non-Towered Airport Operations|18]], [[PPL.19 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|19]], [[PPL.20 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|20]], [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|21]], & [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|22]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.
