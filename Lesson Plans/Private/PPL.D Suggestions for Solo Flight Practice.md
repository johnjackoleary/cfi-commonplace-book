> [[ATC]] wants to help students improve. It's good to include "student solo" in your initial transmission with each new controller.

# Initial Solo Practice
*Get a feel for flying solo.*
- Fly the traffic pattern. Practice [[PPL1.4 Normal and Crosswind Takeoffs and Climbs|takeoffs]], [[PPL3.2 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings|normal landings]], and [[PPL3.5 Short- and Soft-Field Takeoffs and Landings|short/soft field landings]].
- Leave for the practice area, work on [[PPL2.1 Slow Flight and Power-Off Stalls|slow flight]] and [[PPL1.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight|four fundamentals]], then return to traffic pattern.

# Nearing Checkride
*Practice everything from the [[Private Pilot ACS]], making sure to understand and achieve all standards.*

> [!note] All references to the [[Private Pilot ACS|ACS]] are for the November 2023 version.
