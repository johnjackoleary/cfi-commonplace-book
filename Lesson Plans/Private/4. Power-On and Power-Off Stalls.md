### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with power-on and power-off stalls.

### References
- [[AFH Ch4]]
- [[PHAK Ch5]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec VII-B and -C
- [[POH]]

### Builds On
[[3. Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
`= this.ground-hr` hour ground, `= this.local-dual-hr` hour flight, with practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. Aerodynamics of stalls
	1. [[Stall]] occurs at critical angle of attack
	2. Stall can occur at ANY airspeed, attitude, or power setting!
	3. Discuss effect from
		1. Change wing shape
			1. flaps: wing generates more lift, so can fly at lower angle of attack w/ flaps, so lower stall speed
		2. Change wing loading
			1. ![[CL and CG and Tail Down Force.jpeg]]
			2. weight, [[CG]], [[load factor]], bank angle, gear
2. Situations where risk of stalls increase
	1. Landing approach, especially skidding base to final turn
	2. Climb-out, trying to clear an obstacle, especially at high density altitude
	3. Emergency landing, power-off glide, trying to stretch the glide
	4. Exceeding mass gross, CG out of limits
	5. Ice or frost accumulation on wings
3. Stall recognition
	1. Sight - high pitch attitude (not always)
	2. Sound - reduced airflow, less wind noise
	3. Feel - mushy controls, less effective, buffeting
4. [[Maneuver - Power-Off Stall]]
5. [[Maneuver - Power-On Stall]]
6. Common errors:
	1. Not maintaining rudder coordination, causing wing to drop during stall, entering spin!
	2. Delay in stall recovery, causing excessive altitude loss or spin entry
	3. Secondary stall due to aggressive pitch up during recovery

### Completion Standards
Client must be able to demonstrate power-off and power-on stalls, to ACS standards. Recovery no lower than 1500' AGL, maintain heading ±10 degrees before stall, or specified bank angle ±10 degrees, recognize stall and recover promptly with proper procedure.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.87]]: Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall;

### Required Homework
 None
### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly power-on stalls
- [ ] Chair fly power-off stalls
