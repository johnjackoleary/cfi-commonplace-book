## Airport Operations (Ground and Tower Communications, Ground Ops, Light Gun Signals)

### Objective
To understand airport operations, including communications, traffic patterns, and light gun signals

### References
- [[AFH Ch2]]
- [[PHAK Ch14]], 
- [[AIM 2-3]],
- Handouts for [[KPAO Airport Diagram.pdf|KPAO taxiways]], [[KPAO Chart Supplement.pdf|Chart Supplements page]], [[Example Radio Calls|common radio calls]], and [[Light Gun Signals]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec III

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Airport Features
	1. Wind Direction Indicators ![[Wind Direction Indicators.jpeg]]
	2. Signs and Markings from [[PHAK Ch14]] and [[AIM 2-3]]
		1. Good summary at [CFI Notebook](https://www.cfinotebook.net/notebook/aircraft-operations/terminal/airport-markings-and-signs)
		2. <iframe src="https://www.cfinotebook.net/notebook/aircraft-operations/terminal/airport-markings-and-signs" width=640 height=480></iframe>
4. Radio communications
	1. Memorize frequencies for Palo Alto: ATIS 135.275, Ground 125.0, Tower 118.6, Emergency 121.5
	2. Format for all radio calls: WHO you're calling, WHO you are, WHERE you are (in 3D space), WHAT you want
	3. Required readbacks: 
		1. Runway #, taxing instructions, hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared-for-takeoff, cleared-to-land, etc.
		2. Sometimes specific request for readback in the ATIS
		3. If in doubt, readback full instructions.
	4. After tuning a frequency, PAUSE before talking to make sure you're not stepping on a conversation (counting to 4 seems to be the magic duration)
	5. Mentally rehearse what you will say before keying the mic.
	6. If in doubt, ask for clarification or request "say again"
	7. Anticipate the response and pay attention for any unusual elements
	8. Stuck microphones -- how to detect, how to respond
5. Taxiing Procedure
	1. Airport and taxiway familiarization
	2. Taxi instructions/clearances
	3. Position of controls relative to wind while taxiing ([[AileronsForWindWhileTaxing.jpeg|Image]])
6. [[Runway Incursions Overview, Risks, and Mitigations]]
7. Radio communications practice:
	1. [[Example Radio Calls]]
	2. Listen to KPAO tower on handheld radio, or online at www.liveatc.net (KPAO tower or KSQL tower and ground, for example)
8. [[Phonetic Alphabet]]
	1. Memorize them! Alpha through Zulu
	2. Special number pronunciations: "Tree" and "Niner"
9. [[Light Gun Signals]]
	1. Debugging common radio issues (volume low, cable disconnect)
	2. Study and memorize the signals
	3. Put a copy onto your kneeboard (people forget in the stress of the moment!)
10. Common Errors
	1. Poor radio etiquette, stepping on others, getting tongue-tied
	2. Not reading back the required information
	3. Not scanning for traffic, or keeping traffic to follow in sight

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate good radio communications and etiquette as specified in the AIM, understand the Palo Alto airport ground and pattern environment, and how to use light signals in case of radio/electrical failure.
