### Objective
Develop ability to obtain, process and understand pre-flight weather briefings, and use weather data. 

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections I.C, I.D
- [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
- [[AC 91-92]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hour, practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]].

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations|PPL4.2]], [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|PPL4.3]], [[PPL4.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|PPL4.4]], [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|PPL4.5]], & [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|PPL4.6]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. Weather and Weather Briefings
	1. Weather theory -- see [[Aviation Weather Handbook]] for best resources
		1. Air Masses and Fronts
			1. [[Winds Around Pressure Systems.jpeg]]
			2. [[Isobars Reveal Pressure Gradient.jpeg]]
			3. Warm, Cold, Stationary, and Occluded Fronts
		2. Atmospheric Stability ([[Temp Lapse Rates Effect on Stability.jpeg]]^[The 3°C per 1000ft is the dry adiabatic lapse rate and 0.5°C is the dew point lapse rate, used in this image. See Chap 12/13 of [[Aviation Weather Handbook]] for more info.])
			1. "As air ascends through the atmosphere, the average rate of temperature change is 2 °C (3.5 °F) per 1,000 feet." - [[PHAK Ch12]]
			2. [[Convective Turbulence Avoidance.jpeg]]
		3. Recognizing [[thunderstorm]]s, [[wind shear]], [[Ice Hazards and Aircraft Icing|ice]], and other critical weather situations
	2. Interpreting weather radar
	3. Weather briefings in depth
		1. Structure of weather briefings
		2. Adverse conditions: [[TFR]]s, [[NOTAM]]s, [[SIGMET]]s, [[AIRMET]]s, etc.
		3. Current weather
		4. Forecasts: Area, [[TAF]]s, [[Winds Aloft]], [[MOS]]
	4. Types of [[weather brief|weather briefings]] from Flight Service
		1. Outlook
		2. Standard
		3. Abbreviated
2. Review of [[All Available Information Concerning That Flight]]^[Similar to [[NWKRAFT]]]
3. Other topics related to cross-country planning and flying:
	1. [[Human Factors]]
	2. How to share expenses? [[AC 61-142]] and [[FAR 61.113 Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations]]^[Good WINGS program online [here](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/ALC/course_content.aspx?cID=1093)]
	3. Flight Services Enroute
	4. [[VFR]] flight plans for search and rescue

		2. How to file
		3. How to activate and close
	5. Estimating visibility in flight^[Some suggestions from [[AOPA]] in [this article](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2008/april/flight-training-magazine/basic-vfr)]


### Completion Standards
Learner should develop working knowledge of weather theory, and understand sources of weather information for pre-flight planning.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]] and [[FAR 61.105 PPL Knowledge Reqs]]:
- Procurement and analysis of aeronautical weather reports and forecasts, including recognition of critical weather situations and estimating visibility while in flight
- Recognition of critical weather situations from the ground and in flight, windshear avoidance, and the procurement and use of aeronautical weather reports and forecasts
- Preflight action that includes—
	- How to obtain information on runway lengths at airports of intended use, data on takeoff and landing distances, weather reports and forecasts, and fuel requirements; and
	- How to plan for alternatives if the planned flight cannot be completed or delays are encountered.

### Required Homework
None
