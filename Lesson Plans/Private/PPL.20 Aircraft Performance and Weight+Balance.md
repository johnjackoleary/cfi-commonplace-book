### Objective
Develop understanding of aircraft limitations and weight & balance, and how to compute aircraft performance and W&B for a cross country flight.

### Resources
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]]
- [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com) for planning online

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
3 hours ground

### CFI Equipment
- [[E6B]] Calculator or App

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons PPL [[PPL.18 Non-Towered Airport Operations|18]], [[PPL.19 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|19]], [[PPL.20 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|20]], [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|21]], & [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|22]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.
