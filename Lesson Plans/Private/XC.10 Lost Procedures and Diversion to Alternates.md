### Objective
Develop skills and procedures to identify aircraft location, with on-board charts or equipment or with ATC help, and plan diversion to an appropriate alternate airport.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections VI.C (diversion) and VI.D (lost procedures)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[XC.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]
- [[XC.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]
- [[XC.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]
- [[SOLO.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hour, Flight 1 hour, frequent practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[XC.9 Emergency Operations]].

### Lesson Elements
1. Lost procedures
	1. Might be appropriate to circle and/or gain altitude for better view of landmarks. Some use the 5 C's: Climb, Circle, Conserve (fuel), Communicate/Confess, Comply
	2. Use of charts and pilotage to find location
	3. Use of GPS nearest airport feature, or VORs
	4. How to get ATC assistance
2. Plan diversion to alternate airport
	1. Use of GPS direct-to feature
	2. Use of VOR navigation, such as crossing VOR radials
	3. Use of charts (paper or electronic) to estimate distance and heading to alternate
	4. Estimate distance, heading, time enroute, and fuel burn to alternate airport
3. In-flight practice
	1. CFI will get learner "lost", typically after maneuvering with the hood during simulated instrument flight
	2. Learner will demonstrate ability to find location, plan route to an alternate airport, and fly to and land at alternate.

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to use multiple means to identify location, and to plan route to an alternate airport, including estimate of distance, time, and fuel usage to the alternate.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Emergency procedures^[Also in [[XC.9 Emergency Operations]]]

### Required Homework
- [ ] Schedule pre-solo xc phase check, if required

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Many GPS devices have a free simulator to practice with, which is useful to build proficiency
