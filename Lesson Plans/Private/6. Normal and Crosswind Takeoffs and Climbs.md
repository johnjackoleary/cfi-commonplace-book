### Objective
To understand and become proficient at the procedures used for normal takeoffs and climbs. 

### References
- [[AFH Ch5]]
- [[PHAK Ch5]], [[PHAK Ch11]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec IV
- [[POH]]

### Builds On
- [[2. Four Fundamentals of Flight]]
- [[3. Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
`= this.ground-hr` hour ground, `= this.local-dual-hr` hours flight, practice every flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Theory
	1. Climb Speed: [[Vx]] or [[Vy]]
	2. [[Ground effect]]
	3. Effect of wind, [[density altitude]], weight, runway surface
	6. Takeoff distance from aircraft performance charts ([[POH]], section V)
2. Practice
	1. Procedure from [[POH]]
	2. Pre-takeoff checks, and traffic checks
	3. Go/No-go location picked out ahead of time. Call out rotate and climb speeds. Recite emergency landing options.
	4. Takeoff clearances: hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared for takeoff
	5. Taking the runway -- Check for traffic, and "[[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]"
	6. Setting controls for cross-wind
	7. Feet off brakes, gentle power application, last check of instruments
	8. Dancing on the rudder pedals to maintain directional control, right rudder as necessary to offset left-turning tendency -- [[Four Left Turning Tendencies]]
	9. Crosswind: transition from side-slip to wings-level crab for climb

		2. ![[Crosswind Slip to Crab.jpeg]]
4. Normal Climbs
	1. Climb out at [[Vy]], set trim, correct for wind to maintain runway centerline
	2. No turns below 400' typically
	3. Awareness of noise abatement rules/recommendations (at Palo Alto, turn right 10 degrees for climb out)
5. Emergency Considerations
	1. Plans for rejected takeoff. Reasons to reject: nose wheel shimmy, engine RPM, something "doesn't feel right", etc
	2. Emergency plans must be in mind BEFORE TAKEOFF
	3. Engine failure on upwind climb -- LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD
6. Common Errors
	1. Ignoring crosswind
	2. Drifting from centerline during takeoff roll
	3. Drifting from centerline during climb out

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency and safety for normal takeoffs and climbs, including pre-takeoff checks, traffic awareness, and emergency options.

### Required Homework
 - [ ] Read through [[POH]] sections I, II, IV, and V

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly takeoffs
- [ ] Rehearse takeoff emergency plans
