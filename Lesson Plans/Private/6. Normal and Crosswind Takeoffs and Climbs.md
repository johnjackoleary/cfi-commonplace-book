### Objective
To understand and become proficient at the procedures used for normal takeoffs and climbs. 

### References
[[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec IV, AFH Ch5, PHAK Ch 11, POH

### Builds On
[[2. Four Fundamentals of Flight]], [[3. Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hour; airplane ~1 hour, practice every flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Takeoffs (no flaps used in most trainers)
	1. Effect of wind and [[density altitude]]
	2. VFR Weather Minimums (see memory aid documents in [table form](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/25/185/vfr%20weather%20minimums.pdf), [[VFR Weather Minimums|list form]], and [[Cloud Clearance Pyramid.jpeg|pyramid form]])
	3. Procedure from [[POH]]
	4. Takeoff distance from aircraft performance charts ([[POH]], section 5)
	5. Pre-takeoff checks, and traffic checks
	6. Go/No-go location picked out ahead of time. Call out rotate and climb speeds. Recite emergency landing options.
	7. Takeoff clearances: hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared for takeoff
	8. Taking the runway -- Check for traffic, and "[[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]"
	9. Setting controls for cross-wind
	10. Feet off brakes, gentle power application, last check of instruments
	11. Dancing on the rudder pedals to maintain directional control, right rudder as necessary to offset left-turning tendency (P-factor) -- [[Four Left Turning Tendencies]]
	12. Crosswind: transition from side-slip to wings-level crab for climb
2. Normal Climbs
	1. Climb out at [[Vy]], set trim, correct for wind to maintain runway centerline
	2. No turns below 400' typically
	3. Awareness of noise abatement rules/recommendations (at Palo Alto, turn right 10 degrees for climbout)
3. Emergency Considerations
	1. Plans for rejected takeoff. Reasons to reject: nosewheel shimmy, engine RPM, comething "doesn't feel right", etc
	2. Emergency plans must be in mind BEFORE TAKEOFF
	3. Engine failure on upwind climb -- LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD
4. Common Errors
	1. Ignoring crosswind
	2. Drifting from centerline during takeoff roll
	3. Drifting from centerline during climb out

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency and safety for normal takeoffs and climbs, including pre-takeoff checks, traffic awareness, and emergency options.

### Required Homework
 - [ ] Read through [[POH]] sections 1, 2, 4, and 5

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly takeoffs
- [ ] Rehearse takeoff emergency plans
