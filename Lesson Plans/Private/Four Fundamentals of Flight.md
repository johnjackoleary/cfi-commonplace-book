## Four Fundamentals of Flight

### Objective
To begin learning the fundamentals of straight and level (S&L) flight, turns, climbs, and descents; and controlling the airplane's attitude by visual reference to the horizon.

### References
- [[AFH Ch3]]
- [[PHAK Ch5]]

### Builds On
[[Preflight, Taxiing, and Post-flight Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, Flight 2 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. [[Forces in Stabilized Flight]]
2. Straight and Level
	1. Scanning for traffic!
	2. Visual horizon to maintain direction and pitch attitude ([[NoseReferenceForSL.jpeg|image]])
	3. Wingtip reference for level flight
	4. Periodic cross-check of altimeter ([[90%-10% Outside vs Inside for Integrated Flight Instruction|aim for 90-10 split of time looking outside vs inside]])
	5. Use of trim
3. Level Turns
	1. Check for traffic (high wing plane - lift wing slightly before banking)
	2. [[Adverse Yaw]]
	3. Rudder coordination, slips, skids, the ball ![[Indications of Slip and Skid.jpeg]]
	4. Use of rudder to initiate and exit turn (cancel out adverse yaw)
	5. Load factor, aft pressure to maintain altitude ![[Forces in Level Turn.jpeg]]
4. Cruise Climbs
	1. To initiate climb:
		1. pitch
		2. power (full)
		3. trim (to relieve control pressure, after aircraft stabilizes)
	2. Use of trim
	3. To level off:
		1. lead by 10% vertical velocity, so 50ft at 500FPM
		2. pitch -- power -- trim
5. Constant Speed Descents
	1. To initiate 500FPM/constant speed descent: 
		1. power (2000 RPM in C172SP)
		2. pitch (occurs naturally)
			1. ![[Reduced Power Pitches Down.jpeg]]
		3. trim (to relieve control pressure, may need little/none here)
	2. Pitch attitude for cruise descent and pattern descent
	3. Trim for desired descent rate or speed
	4. To level off:
		1. lead by 10% vertical velocity, so 50ft at 500FPM
		2. power -- pitch (occurs naturally) -- trim
6. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to scan for traffic
	2. Overcontrolling - use pressure, not movement, of controls
	3. Chasing the instruments - looking at the instruments too often
	4. Too firm grip on controls - relax, use fingertip pressure
	5. Lack of rudder coordination

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate ability to use external visual references to maintain appropriate pitch and bank attitudes, with occasional cross-check of aircraft instruments. Learner must develop habit of visual scanning for traffic, and check for traffic before maneuvers. (ACS standards: &plusmn;10 knots, &plusmn;10 degrees, &plusmn;100 feet)

### Required Logbook Notes
For [[FAR 61.87]]: Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions; Climbs and climbing turns;

### Required Homework

- [ ] Sign up for ground school if not yet completed (WVFC, Sporty's, etc)
