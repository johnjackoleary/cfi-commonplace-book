## Four Fundamentals of Flight

**Objective:** To become proficient at S&L flight, turns, climbs, and descents, controlling the airplane's attitude by visual reference to the horizon.
**References:** AFH Ch3, PHAK Ch 1-8
**Builds On:** [[Introductory Flight, Preflight, Taxing and Post-flight Procedures]]
**Schedule:** Ground 1 hour, flight 1.5 hours
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Straight and Level
	1. Scanning for traffic!
	2. Visual horizon to maintain direction and pitch attitude
	3. Wingtip reference for level flight
	4. Periodic cross-check of altimeter (not too often)
	5. Use of trim
2. Climbs
	1. To initiate climb: power -- pitch -- trim
	2. Pitch attitudes for climb at Vy and Vx
	3. Use of trim
3. Descents
	1. To initiate descent: Pitch -- power -- trim
	2. Pitch attitude for cruise descent and pattern descent
	3. Trim for desired descent rate or speed
4. Turns
	1. Check for traffic (high wing plane - lift wing slight before banking)
	2. Adverse yaw
	3. Rudder coordination, slips, skids, the ball
	4. Use of rudder to initiate and exit turn (cancel out adverse yaw)
	5. Load factor, aft pressure to maintain altitude
5. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to scan for traffic
	2. Overcontrolling - use pressure, not movement, of controls
	3. Chasing the instruments - looking at the instruments too often
	4. Too firm grip on controls - relax, use fingertip pressure
	5. Lack of rudder coordination

**Completion Standards:** Client must demonstrate ability to use external visual references to maintain appropriate pitch and bank attitudes, with occasional cross-check of aircraft instruments. Client must develop habit of visual scanning for traffic, and check for traffic before maneuvers. (ACS standards: &plusmn;10 knots, &plusmn;10 degrees, &plusmn;100 feet)

**Required Homework:**
- [ ] Sign up for ground school if not yet completed (WVFC, Sporty's, etc)

**Recommended Homework:** 
- [ ] Chair fly four fundamentals
