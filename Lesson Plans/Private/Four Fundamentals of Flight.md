## Four Fundamentals of Flight

### Objective
To become proficient at S&L flight, turns, climbs, and descents, controlling the airplane's attitude by visual reference to the horizon.

### References
[[AFH Ch3]], PHAK Ch [[PHAK Ch1|1]], [[PHAK Ch2|2]], [[PHAK Ch3|3]], [[PHAK Ch4|4]], [[PHAK Ch5|5]], [[PHAK Ch6|6]], [[PHAK Ch7|7]], [[PHAK Ch8|8]]

#todo :: trim these references to minimum set

### Builds On
[[Introductory Flight, Preflight, Taxiing, and Post-flight Procedures]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, Flight 1.5 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Straight and Level
	1. Scanning for traffic!
	2. Visual horizon to maintain direction and pitch attitude ([[NoseReferenceForSL.jpeg|image]])
	3. Wingtip reference for level flight
	4. Periodic cross-check of altimeter ([[90%-10% Outside vs Inside for Integrated Flight Instruction|aim for 90-10 split of time looking outside vs inside]])
	5. Use of trim
2. Climbs
	1. To initiate climb:
		1. pitch (to Vy, approximately 10Â°)
			1. #todo :: verify this degree
		2. power (full)
		3. trim (to relieve control pressure, after aircraft stabilizes)
	2. Pitch attitudes for climb at Vy and Vx
		1. #todo :: make sure convergence of Vx and Vy as altitude increases is captured in later lesson
	3. Use of trim
	4. To level off:
		1. lead by 10% vertical velocity, so 50ft at 500FPM
		2. pitch -- power -- trim
3. Constant Speed Descents
	1. To initiate 500FPM/constant speed descent: 
		1. power (2000 RPM in C172SP)
		2. pitch (occurs naturally)
		3. trim (to relieve control pressure, may need little/none here)
	2. Pitch attitude for cruise descent and pattern descent
	3. Trim for desired descent rate or speed
	4. To level off:
		1. lead by 10% vertical velocity, so 50ft at 500FPM
		2. power -- pitch (occurs naturally) -- trim
4. Turns
	1. Check for traffic (high wing plane - lift wing slightly before banking)
	2. Adverse yaw
	3. Rudder coordination, slips, skids, the ball
	4. Use of rudder to initiate and exit turn (cancel out adverse yaw)
	5. Load factor, aft pressure to maintain altitude
5. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to scan for traffic
	2. Overcontrolling - use pressure, not movement, of controls
	3. Chasing the instruments - looking at the instruments too often
	4. Too firm grip on controls - relax, use fingertip pressure
	5. Lack of rudder coordination

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate ability to use external visual references to maintain appropriate pitch and bank attitudes, with occasional cross-check of aircraft instruments. Client must develop habit of visual scanning for traffic, and check for traffic before maneuvers. (ACS standards: &plusmn;10 knots, &plusmn;10 degrees, &plusmn;100 feet)

### Required Homework

- [ ] Sign up for ground school if not yet completed (WVFC, Sporty's, etc)

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly four fundamentals
