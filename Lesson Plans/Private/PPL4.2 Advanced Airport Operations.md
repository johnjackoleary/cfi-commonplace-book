### Objective
Cross-country trips take us to many new airports, some of which are non-towered.  This lesson builds on [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]], including general preparation, procedures that are specific to non-towered airports, and review airport markings and lighting systems.

### Resources
- [AOPA's "Operations at Nontowered Airports"](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/files/aopa/home/pilot-resources/asi/safety-advisors/sa08.pdf) #safety-advisors from [[Air Safety Institute]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section III.B
- [[Non-Tower Radio Communication Examples]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL3.1 Flying the Traffic Pattern and Go-Arounds]]
- [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hours, 1 hour sim/flight

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations|PPL4.2]], [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|PPL4.3]], [[PPL4.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|PPL4.4]], [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|PPL4.5]], & [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|PPL4.6]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. Review [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
2. Planning ahead to visit a new airport
	1. Look up and note all the frequencies you'll need, including weather, tower, ground, and approach/departure
		1. Non-towered airport frequencies: [[Unicom]], [[CTAF]]
		2. Towered airports become non-towered when tower closed
	2. Review the runway layout: numbering, lengths, left/right pattern, [[TPA]]
	3. Read the AF/D Entry: Any disagreements with Foreflight?  Are there noise abatement procedures?  Which is the calm wind runway?
	4. Are there [[NOTAM|NOTAMs]]?
	5. Look at it in Google Maps or other satellite view. Get a feel for the layout. Can you identify transient parking? Any old runways that could cause confusion (such as at [New Jerusalem Airport](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B040'40.0%22N+121%C2%B018'04.0%22W/@37.677778,-121.301111,5016m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d37.677778!4d-121.301111?hl=en&entry=ttu))
	6. Check terrian on Sectional and Google Earth, to get a sense of the surrounding hills
	7. Where to record this in XC planner
3. En route, pick up the weather as soon as it's in range
	1. Pick up [[ATIS]]/[[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]] on the radio
	2. Note the time on hourly broadcasts (normally updated ~55 minutes after the hour).  Will there be a newer report before you arrive?
	3. Review elements of an ATIS. Why each one is useful?
4. Possibly overfly before landing
	1. Airport markings
		1. Segment circle, pattern indicators ![[Segmented Circle.jpeg]]
		2. Wind indicators: [[Wind Sock]], tees, tetrahedrons ![[Wind Direction Indicators.jpeg]]
	2. Airport lighting
		1. Airport beacons (white/green: land+civilian, white/white/green: military)
		3. Pilot controlled lighting
		4. Glidepath systems 
			1. [[VASI]]
			2. [[PAPI]]
5. Plan your arrival and entry
	1. Computing [[TOD]]: [[Stabilized Approach|3-1 Principle]] or assume 500 [[FPM]]
	2. Determining the [[Active Runway]] based on wind, current activity, or designated calm wind runway
	3. Planning pattern entry (and use of tools like ForeFlight)
		1. Overhead entries, and standard 45-degree entry to traffic patterns
		2.  ![[Non-Towered Pattern Entry.jpeg]]
		3. Straight-Ins? Not illegal, but not usually a good idea
	4. Traffic Pattern
		1. Standard traffic patterns to the left, unless charts indicate Right traffic (See "RP 31" for KPAO on sectional)
			1. All turns must be to the left (or right, if right traffic) while in pattern! ([[FAR 91.126 Class G Airport Ops]])
			2. ![[Single Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
	5. Parallel runway operations (see [[AIM 4-3]]) require extra care ![[Parallel Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
6. Make your radio calls
	1. [[Non-Tower Radio Communication Examples]]
	2. Remember, some aircraft don't have radios
7. Landing at a non-towered airport requires extra vigilance-- it can be the Wild West.
	1. Reminder of safety considerations from [[PPL3.2 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]] ([[Wake Turbulence]], [[FAR 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules|Right-of-Way Rules]], [[Runway Incursion]], awareness of other operations, etc)
8. On the ground, be vigilant and use the radio to broadcast your movements
9. Departing the traffic pattern and airport
	1. [[FAA]] endorses only straight-out or 45-degree (L/R matching pattern direction) departure
	2. Be aware, individuals sometimes depart from crosswind or downwind leg
	3. Turn enroute when clear of pattern
10. Common errors
	1. Forgetting radio calls
	2. Selecting wrong runway or inappropriate entry procedure to pattern
	3. Lack of awareness of other aircraft

### Completion Standards
Client should demonstrate knowledge of non-towered airport operations, including obtaining pre-flight information, airport markings, traffic pattern procedures, radio communications, and awareness of other aircraft.
