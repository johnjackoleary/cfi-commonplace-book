### Objective
Learner understands the structure and flow of cross-country lessons, including an overview of aspects which make cross country ([[XC]]) flying different.

### Resources
> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations]].

### Lesson Elements
#### Cross Country Overview
- Essentially means flying from point A to point B^[Official definition in [[FAR 61.1 Applicability and Definitions]]]
- Adds a new dimension to flying, and requires pilot to be familiar with more subjects and procedures
- Logging time: For [[PPL]]/[[CPL]]/[[IRA]] experience requirements, different than more general definiton
	- Importantly, must include *"a point of landing that was at least a straight-line distance of more than 50 nautical miles from the original point of departure"*^[[[FAR 61.1 Applicability and Definitions]] and [[Keller 2009]]]^[Note though, how you break up a flight log is up to you, and this can allow certain flights to count partially as xc time -- see [[Van Zanen 2009]]]
	- Good habit to note the furthest straight-line distance from original point of departure for each xc flight

#### Lesson Structure and Flow
- Lessons XC.2-XC.7^[May be helpful to review flow from [[~ PPL Blocks of Learning.png]] and [[XC Syllabus Topics On Flight Plan.pdf]]] cover key requirements to plan and execute a successful cross-country flight. These subjects include:
	- More detail on airport procedures, including non-towered airports
	- Planning and plotting a course, keeping in mind obstacles and airspace restrictions, and making use of radio navigation aids
	- Computing and adjusting weight & balance with more passengers, luggage, and fuel
	- Computing fuel requirements based on weather and your aircraft's performance
	- Getting briefings with key information ([[NWKRAFT]]) on your origin, destination, and points along the way
	- Using pilotage and dead reckoning to fly without radio navigation aids
	- Go/no-go decisions
- Lessons XC.8-XC.10 cover handling the unexpected
	- Resolving things that can go wrong
	- Flying by reference to instruments, Emergency operations, Lost procedures and diversion to an alternate

#### Flight Planner
- Pilots often use [a planner like this one](https://www.dauntless-soft.com/products/Freebies/VFRFlightPlanner/).Â 
	- There are other versions^[You can find others in [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]], but we'll use this one during training.
- Each of the XC lessons will teach you how to fill out one section of the planner. ![[XC Syllabus Topics On Flight Plan.pdf]]
- One approach is to keep the same printed navlog to fill out across multiple lessons, as a way of learning each new topic without starting again from scratch

#### Goals during XC flights
- You do not need to complete all ground topics to start flying XC trips^[For instance, after [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]], flying a trip using [[GPS]] to navigate there and [[VOR]]s to navigate back would be beneficial.]
- Your CFI can cover the parts of the trip you haven't yet learned (e.g. fuel, W&B, xc weather).
- See [[PPL.E Suggestions for XC Activities and Destinations]] for ideas, or plan a trip you're excited about with your CFI
