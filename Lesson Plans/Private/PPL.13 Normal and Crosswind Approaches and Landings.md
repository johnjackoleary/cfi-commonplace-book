### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with normal and crosswind approach and landing.

### References
- [[AFH Ch9]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec IV-B
- [[POH]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.6 Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]
- [[PPL.8 Power-On and Power-Off Stalls]]
- [[PPL.4 Normal and Crosswind Takeoffs and Climbs]]
- [[PPL.12 Flying the Traffic Pattern and Go-Arounds]]

### Schedule
`= this.ground-hr + " hour" + choice(this.ground-hr <= 1,"","s")` ground, `= this.local-dual-hr + " hour" + choice(this.local-dual-hr <= 1,"","s")` flight, multiple flights to practice as necessary

### Lesson Elements
1. Goal of landing: Smoothly transfer weight from wings to wheels
2. Determining landing performance and limitations ([[POH]])
3. Other Safety Concerns: Awareness of traffic, obstructions, hazards, wake turbulence -- all factors which may require a go-around
	1. Collision Avoidance
		1. Clearing Procedures
			1. Clearing Turns
			2. Avoid descending into traffic patterns
			3. Several more good suggestions in [[PHAK Ch14]]
		2. Scanning for traffic
			1. 10° at a time
			2. Key points in pattern
		3. [[FAR 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules]]
		4. [[Runway Incursions]] ([[Runway Incursions Overview, Risks, and Mitigations]])
			1. #todo :: Dedup these
		5. Awareness of other operations, such as parachuting
	2. [[Wake Turbulence]] from helicopters, and heavy aircraft
	3. [[Wind Shear]] avoidance
	4. [[Gust Factor]] for final approach speed
4. Importance of Stabilized Approach to landing
	1. [[Aiming point]]
	2. ![[Runway Shape in Stablized Approach.jpeg]]
6. In the Pattern
	1. Downwind leg
		1. Awareness of traffic
		2. Power setting, configuration, airspeed for downwind
		3. Complete pre-landing checklist ([[POH]], [[FCCGUMPS]])
		4. Cross-wind correction if necessary
		5. Downwind abeam-the-numbers, start descent (traffic permitting)
	2. Base leg
		1. Turn base at 45° to approach end of runway
		2. Adjust configuration (flaps, speed, trim)
		3. Evaluate altitude, distance, wind. Correct as necessary
	3. Final approach
		1. Coordinate turn to roll-out on runway centerline, establish cross-wind correction as needed ![[Crabbed Approach.jpeg]]
		2. Set flaps, trim for final approach speed
		3. Pitch for airspeed, power for altitude (use glidepath indicator if available). One hand on stick/yoke, other on throttle
		4. Maintain runway centerline
		5. Fly to [[aiming point]] ![[Stablized Approach.jpeg]]
			1. Note on why I don't like this image
	4. Roundout/Flare
		1. Judge speed and altitude to short final
		2. Use ailerons to maintain centerline, rudder to keep nose pointing down the runway, parallel to centerline (this is a "Side-Slip") ![[Sideslip Approach.jpeg]] 
		3. Use side-slip to avoid drifting on touchdown ![[Drifting on Touchdown.jpeg]]
		4. Usually start flare about one wing-span above runway (entering [[ground effect]])
		5. Use peripheral vision to judge descent rate
	5. Touchdown
		1. Smooth power reduction and pitch increase to level off just above runway at idle power
		2. Hold off with increasing back pressure to touch down in full-stall attitude 
		3. ![[Well Executed Roundout.jpeg]]
	6. Rollout
		1. Maintain centerline with rudder
		2. Deflect ailerons into the wind, gradually increasing to full deflection at taxi speed
		3. Gentle braking
	7. Taxi
		1. Exit runway, completely beyond hold-short lines
		2. Stop and complete after-landing checklist
		3. Contact ground frequency (unless staying with tower)
7. Landing Issues to Avoid
	1. Multiple bounces may be a sign of [[Porpoising.jpeg]], go-around and don't let this develop!
8. Common Errors
	1. Getting "behind the airplane", missing radio calls, missing traffic, etc.
	2. Forgetting checklists
	3. Non-stabilized approach
	4. Flaring too high or too low, bouncing, ballooning
	5. Poor directional control or drifting off centerline
	6. Excessive braking!

### Completion Standards
Learner must become proficient at flying stabilized approaches to landing, with smooth control application and safe touchdown and rollout in first third of runway length, with proper control application relative to crosswind.
