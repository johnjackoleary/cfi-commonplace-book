### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with emergency landings, including choosing an emergency landing location and considerations for a survivable landing.

### References
- [[AFH Ch18]]
- [[AFM]]/[[POH]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section IX

### Builds On
- [[PPL.13 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]]
- [[PPL.14 Forward Slips to Landing]]

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 1 hour flight, frequent practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority]]:
	1. > [!cite] In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to the extent required to meet that emergency.
2. Types of emergency landings: forced landing, precautionary landing, ditching
3. [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]]
4. [[ABCDE]]
	1. Airspeed - best glide [[Vg]]
	2. Best place to land -- (hopefully) a preselected landing area
		1. Turn there immediately!
		2. Land INTO the wind!
		3. If altitude allows: GPS NRST - what is closest airport?
		4. If you identify a better place on the way, can change this. But should turn to best known option right away.
		5. Rule of Thumb: Can glide 1.5 NM per 1000 feet altitude in C172SP (see also [[POH]])
	3. Checklist
		1.  Flow from memory based on type of emergency
		2. Cross-check POH checklist (best to have paper copy ready!)
	4. Declare
		1. Squawk [[Squawk 7700]]
		2. Mayday call with Approach or Center, nearby tower, or 121.5 (last resort)
	5. Execute emergency landing
		1. Survival statement
		2. Get to key point @1000' AGL: Spiral descent, then rectangular pattern (if altitude permits) ![[Key Position for Power Off 180.jpeg]]
5. Details on flying the approach
	1. Effects of headwinds/tailwinds 
		1. ![[Effect of Headwind on Landing Point.jpeg]]
	2. Aircraft configuration, such as gear and flaps ![[Flaps Effect on Landing Point.jpeg]]
	3. Keep altitude, and plan to use [[PPL.14 Forward Slips to Landing|forward slip]] to control touchdown location
	4. Don't try to stretch a glide! ![[Stretching a Glide.jpeg]]
	5. Securing fuel and electrical systems before landing
	6. Unlatch doors before touchdown
	7. Maintain aircraft control all the way through the landing -- controlled landing in bad terrain is better then uncontrolled landing in good terrain
6. Considerations for safe landing
	1. Protect the cabin: Can keep the aircraft cabin in tact by using dispensable structures (wings, landing gear, etc)
	2. Protect the passengers: Make sure seatbelts are on and secure
	3. Remove energy slowly on landing: look for ways to absorb energy during landing (field of corn, brush), and reduce groundspeed as much as possible
		1. Trying to minimize peak deceleration in controlled crash -- spread out the energy loss
7. Notes on best terrain selection
	1. Roads are a tempting options, especially at night, but most large road carry a risk of manmade structures like electrical wires that will be hard to see from far away. Plus, there's traffic on the road -- it may not be your best option.
	2. Read through additional comments from [[FAA]] in [[AFH Ch18]]
8. Considerations for ditching
	1. High Winds, Heavy Seas - INTO THE WIND 
	2. Light Winds, Heavy Swells - PARALLEL TO SWELLS
9. Psychological Hazards
	1. Not accepting situation - wasting altitude instead of immediately starting on [[ABCDE]]
	2. Desire to save airplane - if the engine quits, it's the insurance company's plane now. Your job is to execute a survivable landing, and sacrificing the aircraft for the safety of the passengers may be the best thing to do
10. Practicing Today
	1. Emergency procedures in flight
	2. Flying to land from key point
11. Common Errors
	1. Aviate first! Don't let distractions lead to loss of control.
	2. Route of flight with few or no landing options
	3. Lack of situational awareness. Be aware of positions and options.
	4. Failure to use checklist
