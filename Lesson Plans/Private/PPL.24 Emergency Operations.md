### Objective
Develop knowledge of all abnormal and emergency procedures for the training aircraft in use, including all ACS risk management and skill tasks.

### Resources
- [[AFM]]/[[POH]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections IX.A,C,D
- [C172 Electrical System Interactive Tool](http://avitmedia.aero.und.edu/c172sElectrical/index.html) from [[UND]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.15 Emergency Landings]]

### Schedule
1.5 hours ground, flight practice as necessary

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as [[PPL.23 Emergency Flight by Instruments - Four Fundamentals]] or [[PPL.25 Lost Procedures and Diversion to Alternates]].

### Lesson Elements
1. [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority]]
3. What is an emergency? When should you declare one?
	1. When the outcome of the flight is in doubt
4. Note: Will cover instrument failures (vacuum or pitot-static system) later. (When?)
5. Fire
	1. Engine fire
		1. In air - Emergency Descent (this is the rapid descent procedure)
			1. Start descent (bank 30°-45°; airspeed >=100 kts; should have positive load factor)
			2. Then once fire out, execute forced landing (see [[PPL.15 Emergency Landings]])
		2. During start on ground
	2. Electrical Fire
	3. Wing Tip Fire
6. Failure
	1. Engine
		1. During flight: see [[PPL.15 Emergency Landings]]
		2. During takeoff roll
		3. Immediately after takeoff: Land straight ahead! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBh1Qd6IgA&t=15s)
	2. Electrical
		1. Malfunctions or complete failure
		2. Nordo (No Radio)
	3. Minimum fuel
	4. Flap failure
	5. Retractable gear malfunction
	6. Door opening in flight
	7. Low oil pressure
7. Unsafe Conditions
	1. [[VFR]] into [[IMC]]
	2. Icing
		1. [[How and Why Carburetor Ice Forms]]
8. Emergency equipment and survival gear
9. Emergency squawk codes: [[Squawk 7700]], [[Squawk 7600]], [[Squawk 7500]]
> [!caution] Even passing through one of these codes will trigger an alert for [[ATC]]. As you set a squawk code, be mindful to not pass through one accidentally.
9. [[Intercept Procedures]]
10. Common errors
	1. Failure to use flow patterns or memory items
	2. Failure to use checklists, or improper use

### Completion Standards
Client demonstrates appropriate knowledge of aircraft systems, abnormal and emergency procedures, and the ability to perform emergency procedures to ACS standards.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Emergency procedures^[Also in [[PPL.25 Lost Procedures and Diversion to Alternates]]]

### Required Homework
- [ ] Memorize emergency flows (you may wish to rent an aircraft and practice on the ground, although a picture also works)

### Recommended Homework
- [ ] Chair fly all emergencies in [[POH]]
