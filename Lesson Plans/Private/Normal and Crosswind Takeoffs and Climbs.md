### Objective
To understand and become proficient at the procedures used for normal takeoffs and climbs. 

### References
[[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec IV, AFH Ch5, PHAK Ch 11, POH

### Builds On
[[Four Fundamentals of Flight]], [[Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hour; airplane ~1 hour, practice every flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Takeoffs (no flaps used in most trainers)
	1. Effect of wind and density altitude
	2. Weather minimums ([[VFR Weather Minimums]])
	3. Takeoff distance from aircraft performance charts
	4. Pre-takeoff checks, and traffic checks
	5. Go/No-go location picked out ahead of time. Call out rotate and climb speeds. Recite emergency landing options.
	6. Takeoff clearances: hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared for takeoff
	7. Taking the runway -- Check for traffic, and "[[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]"
	8. Setting controls for cross-wind
	9. Feet off brakes, gentle power application, last check of instruments
	10. Dancing on the rudder pedals to maintain directional control, right rudder as necessary to offset left-turning tendency (P-factor)
	11. Crosswind: transition from side-slip to wings-level crab for climb
2. Normal Climbs
	1. Climb out at Vy, set trim, correct for wind to maintain runway senterline
	2. No turns below 400' typically
	3. Awareness of noise abatement rules/recommendations (at Palo Alto, turn right 10 degrees for climbout)
3. Emergency Considerations
	1. Plans for rejected takeoff. Reasons to reject: nosewheel shimmy, engine RPM, comething "doesn't feel right", etc
	2. Emergency plans must be in mind BEFORE TAKEOFF
	3. Engine failure on upwind climb -- LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD
4. Common Errors
	1. Ignoring crosswind
	2. Drifting from centerline during takeoff roll
	3. Drifting from centerline during climb out

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency and safety for normal takeoffs and climbs, including pre-takeoff checks, traffic awareness, and emergency options.

### Required Homework
 None

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly takeoffs
- [ ] Rehearse takeoff emergency plans
