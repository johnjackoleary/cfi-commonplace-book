### Objective
Develop knowledge of the aerodynamics of steep turns, including load factor and effect on stall speed. Develop risk management and skills associated with steep turns.

### Builds On
[[PPL.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 1.0 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Aerodynamics of steep turns
	1. [[Adverse yaw]] and rudder usage to compensate for it
	2. Rudder usage during turn entry, steady turn, and turn exit
	3. Over-banking tendency -- possibly causing crossed controls during turn
		1. #todo :: add images
	4. Load factor (g force) varies with bank angle (reciprocal of cosine of bank angle)
	5. Stall speed varies with square root of load factor![[Bank Versus Stall Speed and Load Factor]]
	6. Most light aircraft designed for 3.8 positive g max (corresponds to 75-degree bank level turn)
	7. [[Maneuvering speed]] Va - define and discuss entry speed for steep turn
2. Flying the maneuver: 
> ![[Maneuver - Steep Turn]]
4. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to scan for traffic or locating emergency field
	2. Using airspeed greater than Va
	3. Letting altitude or bank angle drift during turn
	4. Lack of rudder coordination
	5. Not adding power to maintain airspeed
	6. Rolling out on wrong heading

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate location, select a safe entry speed, perform 360-degree turn in either direction with 45-degree bank, maintaining altitude and adding power to maintain airspeed. Tolerances: ±100 feet, ±10 knots, ±5 degrees bank, ±10 degrees heading on rollout.

### Required Homework
