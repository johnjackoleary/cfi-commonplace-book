### Objective
Develop knowledge of operations and traffic patterns at non-towered airports.

### Schedule
`= this.ground-hr + " hour" + choice(this.ground-hr <= 1,"","s")` ground, `= this.local-dual-hr + " hour" + choice(this.local-dual-hr <= 1,"","s")` flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Pre-Flight
	1. Sources for airport information and data (chart supplements, [[EFB]]), [[NOTAM|NOTAMs]]
	2. Non-towered airport frequencies: [[Unicom]], [[CTAF]]
	3. Tower airports become non-towered when tower closed
	5. Weather sources: [[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]], 1800wxbrief.com, telephone
	6. Airport markings
		1. #todo :: Dedup with [[5. Towered Airport Operations]]
		2. Segment circle, pattern indicators
		3. Wind indicators: sock, tees, tetrahedrons
		4. Runway and taxi markings
	7. Airport lighting
		1. #todo :: Dedup with [[5. Towered Airport Operations]]
		2. Airport beacons
		3. Pilot controlled lighting
		4. Glidepath systems
3. Non-towered airport operations
	2. Pattern Planning and Entry
		1. Determining the [[Active Runway]]
		2. Planning pattern entry (and use of tools like ForeFlight)
		3. Standard traffic patterns to the left, unless charts indicate Right traffic (See "RP 31" for KPAO on sectional)
		4. Overhead entries, and standard 45-degree entry to traffic patterns
		5. Pattern entries and departures ![[Non-Towered Pattern Entry.jpeg]]
		6. Parallel runway operations (see [[AIM 4-3]])
	4. [[Radio Usage at Non-Towered Airports]]
	5. Reminder of safety considerations from [[9. Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]] ([[Wake Turbulence]], [[FAR 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules|Right-of-Way Rules]], [[Runway Incursion]], awareness of other operations, etc)
4. Common errors
	1. Forgetting radio calls
	2. Selecting wrong runway or inappropriate entry procedure to pattern
	3. Lack of awareness of other aircraft


### Completion Standards
Client should demonstrate knowledge of non-towered airport operations, including obtaining pre-flight information, airport markings, traffic pattern procedures, radio communications, and awareness of other aircraft.

### Required Homework
None

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly entry to non-towered airport, from several directions and various wind, with radio calls
