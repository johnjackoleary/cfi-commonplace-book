### Schedule
`= this.ground-hr + " hour" + choice(this.ground-hr <= 1,"","s")` ground

### Lesson Elements
#todo :: Should required preflight be part of a lesson on preflight generally? (IMSAFE, PAVE, Weather, TFR, etc). Consider splitting this lesson into two.

1. Required Preflight Action ([[FAR 91.103]]) - [[NWKRAFT]]
	1. "all available information concerning that flight"
	2. Notams
	3. Weather reports and forecasts
		1. [[Weather Brief]] -- 1800wxbrief.com (or call 1800wxbrief) 
			1. #todo :: Add a note in future lesson about calling 1800wxbrief
		2. [[METAR]]
		3. [[PIREP]]s
		4. [[ATIS]], [[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]]
		5. [[TAF]]
		6. [[AIRMET]] / [[SIGMET]]
	4. Known traffic delays
	5. Runway lengths
	6. Available alternatives
	7. Fuel requirements ([[FAR 91.151 VFR Fuel Reqs]], [[POH]])
		1. #todo :: Is this the best lesson for fuel burn discussion?
	8. Takeoff and landing distance -- aircraft performance vs airport elevation, gross weight, wind and temperatures
3. Terminal (1:250,000 scale) and Sectional (1:500,000 scale) charts
	1. ![[VFR Chart Legend.pdf|chart symbology]]
4. [[Chart Supplement]] (formerly Airports/Facility Directory, still called A/FD in ForeFlight) - [[KPAO Chart Supplement.pdf|image]]
5. [[National Airspace System]]
	1. Types of airspace -- Class A, B, C, D, E, G
	2. [[FAR 91.155 VFR Weather Minimums]] (see memory aid documents in [table form](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/25/185/vfr%20weather%20minimums.pdf), [[VFR Weather Minimums List Memory Aid|list form]], and [[Cloud Clearance Pyramid.jpeg|pyramid form]])
	3. Altitudes for cruise flight ([[FAR 91.159 VFR Altitudes]])
	4. Minimum safe altitudes ([[FAR 91.119 Minimum Altitudes]])
