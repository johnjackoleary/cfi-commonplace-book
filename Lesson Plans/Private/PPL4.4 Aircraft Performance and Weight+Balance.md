### Objective
Develop understanding of aircraft limitations and weight & balance, and how to compute aircraft performance and W&B for a cross country flight.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section I.F
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]]
- [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com) for planning online

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL1.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
3 hours ground

### CFI Equipment
- [[E6B]] Calculator or App

### Lesson Elements

1. Organization of [[POH]]
2. Weight and Balance calculations
	1. Effect of CG location on stability and performance ([[Static vs Dynamic Stability and How Trainer Planes Are Designed]])
	2. Effect of gross weight on performance
	3. How to calculate
3. Performance calculations
	1. [[Wind Triangle]] and relevant terminology
		1. [[Course]] - intended path over the earth
		2. [[Heading]] - where the plane's nose is pointing
		3. [[Track]] - actual path over the ground
		4. Bearing is the angle from you to some point you want to reach.Â  Generally, you plan a Course based on the Bearing of your destination or new waypoint.
		5. [[Magnetic Variation]]
		6. [[Magnetic Deviation]]
	2. Using an [[E6B]]
		1. Finding [[TAS]]
		2. Finding [[WCA]] and [[GS]]
		3. Other practice problems [here](https://e6b.org) or [here](https://flightapprentice.com/resources/exercises/e6b_workbook.pdf)
	3. Takeoff and landing distances for ground roll and obstacle clearance
	4. Rate of climb and time to climb
	5. Impact of [[Density Altitude]] on takeoff and climb performance
	6. Power settings for cruise, airspeed and fuel burn
		1. Importance of and methods for [[Leaning the Mixture]]
	7. [[Personal Minimums]] and other safety factor considerations 

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]] and [[FAR 61.105 PPL Knowledge Reqs]]:
- Use of aircraft performance charts pertaining to cross-country flight
