### Objective
Develop understanding of aircraft limitations and weight & balance, and how to compute aircraft performance and W&B for a cross country flight.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section I.F
- [[POH]]/[[AFM]]
- [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com) for planning online

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL1.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
3 hours ground

### CFI Equipment
- [[E6B]] Calculator or App

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations|XC.2]], [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|XC.3]], [[PPL4.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|XC.4]], [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|XC.5]], & [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|XC.6]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. Organization of [[POH]]
2. Weight and Balance calculations
	1. Effect of CG location on stability and performance ([[Static vs Dynamic Stability and How Trainer Planes Are Designed]])
	2. Effect of gross weight on performance
	3. How to calculate
3. Performance calculations
	1. [[Wind Triangle]] and relevant terminology
		1. [[Course]] - intended path over the earth
		2. [[Heading]] - where the plane's nose is pointing
		3. [[Track]] - actual path over the ground
		4. Bearing is the angle from you to some point you want to reach.Â  Generally, you plan a Course based on the Bearing of your destination or new waypoint.
		5. [[Magnetic Variation]]
		6. [[Magnetic Deviation]]
	2. Using an [[E6B]]
		1. Finding [[TAS]]
		2. Finding [[WCA]] and [[GS]]
		3. Other practice problems [here](https://e6b.org) or [here](https://flightapprentice.com/resources/exercises/e6b_workbook.pdf)
	3. Takeoff and landing distances for ground roll and obstacle clearance
	4. Rate of climb and time to climb
	5. Power settings for cruise, airspeed and fuel burn
		1. Importance of and methods for [[Leaning the Mixture]]
	6. [[Personal Minimums]] and other safety factor considerations 

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
