### Objective
Learner understands the structure and flow of cross-country lessons, including an overview of aspects which make cross country ([[XC]]) flying different.

> [!note]
> You do not need to complete all ground topics to start flying XC trips. For instance, after [[XC.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]], flying a trip using [[GPS]] to navigate there and [[VOR]]s to navigate back would be beneficial. Your CFI can cover the parts of the trip you haven't yet learned (e.g. fuel, W&B, xc weather).

### Resources
> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as [[XC.2 Advanced Airport Operations]].

### Lesson Elements
- Cross country
	- Essentially means flying from point A to point B^[Official definition in [[FAR 61.1]]]
	- Adds a new dimension to flying, and requires pilot to be familiar with more subjects and procedures
	- Logging time: For [[PPL]]/[[CPL]]/[[IRA]] experience requirements, different than more general definiton
		- Importantly, must include **"a point of landing that was at least a straight-line distance of more than 50 nautical miles from the original point of departure"**^[[[FAR 61.1]]]
		- How you break up a flight log is up to you, and can allow certain flight paths to count partially as xc time -- see [[Van Zanen 2009]]

Lessons XC.2-7^[May be helpful to review flow from [[~ PPL Blocks of Learning.png]] and [[XC Syllabus Topics On Flight Plan.pdf]]] cover all the subjects required to plan and execute a successful cross-country flight. At a high level, these subjects include:
- More detail on airport procedures, including non-towered airports
- Planning and plotting a course, keeping in mind obstacles and airspace restrictions, and making use of radio navigation aids
- Computing weight & balance when you have more passengers, luggage, and fuel
- Computing fuel requirements based on your aircraft's performance
- Getting weather briefings for your destination and points along the way
- Using pilotage and dead reckoning to fly without radio navigation aids
- Go/no-go decisions

Pilots often use [a planner like this one](https://www.dauntless-soft.com/products/Freebies/VFRFlightPlanner/). There are others, but we'll use this one during training.  Each of the lessons above will teach you how to fill out one section of the planner.

Then we have another 3 lessons covering things that can go wrong, and how to handle them:
- Flying by reference to instruments
- Emergency operations
- Lost procedures and diversion to an alternate

One you have sufficient mastery of these subjects, both on the ground and in the air, you'll be ready for your first cross-country solo!

- Structure of XC Lessons
	- Lessons [[XC.2 Advanced Airport Operations|XC.2]], [[XC.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|XC.3]], [[XC.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|XC.4]], [[XC.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|XC.5]], & [[XC.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|XC.6]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.
	- [[XC.7 Making the Go-No-Go Decision]] specifically discusses how to make a go/no-go decision with all the information you've gather.
- Review all parts of the cross-country navlog planner
