### Objective
Now that you've soloed, we're going to start working on cross-country flying.  "Cross country" just refers to a flight that starts at point A and ends at point B.  Point B could be a lunch stop a half hour away, or a vacation destination where you're carrying friends and luggage.  In all these cases, cross-country flights add a new dimension to flying, and require the pilot to be familiar with many more subjects and procedures.

Lessons XC.2-7^[May be helpful to review flow from [[~ PPL Blocks of Learning.png]]] cover all the subjects required to plan and execute a successful cross-country flight. At a high level, these subjects include:
- More detail on airport procedures, including non-towered airports
- Planning and plotting a course, keeping in mind obstacles and airspace restrictions, and making use of radio navigation aids
- Computing weight & balance when you have more passengers, luggage, and fuel
- Computing fuel requirements based on your aircraft's performance
- Getting weather briefings for your destination and points along the way
- Using pilotage and dead reckoning to fly without radio navigation aids
- Go/no-go decisions

Pilots often use [a planner like this one](https://www.dauntless-soft.com/products/Freebies/VFRFlightPlanner/). There are others, but we'll use this one during training.  Each of the lessons above will teach you how to fill out one section of the planner.

Then we have another 3 lessons covering things that can go wrong, and how to handle them:
- Flying by reference to instruments
- Emergency operations
- Lost procedures and diversion to an alternate

One you have sufficient mastery of these subjects, both on the ground and in the air, you'll be ready for your first cross-country solo!

> [!note]
> You do not need to complete all ground topics to start flying XC trips. For instance, after [[XC.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]], flying a trip using [[GPS]] to navigate there and [[VOR]]s to navigate back would be beneficial. Your CFI would then cover the parts of the trip you haven't yet learned (e.g. fuel, W&B, xc weather).
