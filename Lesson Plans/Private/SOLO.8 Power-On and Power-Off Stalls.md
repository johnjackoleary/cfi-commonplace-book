### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with power-on and power-off stalls.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections VII.B and VII.C
- [[POH]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[SOLO.6 Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
0.5 hour ground, 2.5 hour flight, with practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. Aerodynamics of stalls
	1. [[Stall]] occurs at critical angle of attack
	2. Stall can occur at ANY airspeed, attitude, or power setting!
	3. Aircraft designed to pitch down at stall 
		1. ![[Longitudinal Stability.png]]
		2. ![[Effect of Speed on Downwash.jpeg]]
	4. Discuss effect from
		1. Change wing shape
			1. flaps: wing generates more lift, so can fly at lower angle of attack w/ flaps, so lower stall speed
		2. Change wing loading
			1. ![[CL and CG and Tail Down Force.jpeg]]
			2. weight, [[CG]], [[Load Factor]], bank angle, gear
	5. Our airplane stalls from the inside back ([[Stall Progression for Various Wing Platforms.jpeg|regular wing]]), but still ailerons will be less effective in a stall^[See [How Wing Washout Makes Your Airplane More Stable](https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/aircraft-systems/how-wing-washout-makes-your-airplane-and-wings-more-stable-when-flying/) for additional info.]
2. Situations where risk of stalls increase
	1. Landing approach, especially skidding base to final turn
	2. Climb-out, trying to clear an obstacle, especially at high density altitude
	3. Emergency landing, power-off glide, trying to stretch the glide
	4. Exceeding max gross, CG out of limits
	5. Ice or frost accumulation on wings
3. Stall recognition
	1. Sight - high pitch attitude (not always)
	2. Sound - reduced airflow, less wind noise
	3. Feel - mushy controls, less effective, buffeting
4. Power Off Stall Maneuver
	1. Simulates stall during approach to landing
	2. Clearing Turns, ID Emergency Field, Outside Reference
	3. Enter slow flight in landing configuration
	4. Descend at approach speed
	5. Pitch up slowly for full stall
	6. Verbally acknowledge stall horn
	7. Continue holding pitch to full stall
	8. Recover: pitch down just below horizon, full power, raise flaps one notch, then incrementally up. Climb [[Vy]].
5. Power On Stall Maneuver
	1. Simulates stall during climb after takeoff
	2. Clearing Turns, ID Emergency Field, Outside Reference
	3. Enter slow flight in takeoff configuration
	4. At [[Vr]], add >65% power
	5. Pitch up slowly for full stall, establish gentle turn if needed
	6. Verbally acknowledge stall horn
	7. Continue holding pitch to full stall
	8. Recover: pitch down to normal climb attitude, full power. Climb Vy.
6. Common errors:
	1. Not maintaining rudder coordination, causing wing to drop during stall, entering spin!
	2. Delay in stall recovery, causing excessive altitude loss or spin entry
	3. Secondary stall due to aggressive pitch up during recovery

### Completion Standards
Client must be able to demonstrate power-off and power-on stalls, to ACS standards. Recovery no lower than 1500' AGL, maintain heading ±10 degrees before stall, or specified bank angle ±10 degrees, recognize stall and recover promptly with proper procedure.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.87 Student Solo Reqs]]: 
- Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall;

### Required Homework
None
 
### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly power-on stalls
- [ ] Chair fly power-off stalls
