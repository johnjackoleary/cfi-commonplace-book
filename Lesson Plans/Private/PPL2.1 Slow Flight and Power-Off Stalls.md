### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with maneuvers during [[slow flight]] and power-off stalls. Understand aerodynamics of slow flight, and develop ability to recognize and recover from impending stall.


### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section VII.A and VII.B
- [[POH]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL1.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
1.5 hours ground, 1.5 hours flight

### Lesson Elements
1. What is slow flight? Why do we practice this?
	1. Flight at high [[AOA]], close to [[stall]], or stall warning
		1. <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://youtube.com/embed/8WKNrfFDaYM?start=1322"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
		2. From [The Secret of Flight 4: Discovery of Dynamic Lift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WKNrfFDaYM) by [University of Iowa](https://www.youtube.com/@universityofiowa)
	2. We experience this during takeoffs, landings, go-arounds
2. Aerodynamics of slow flight
	1. Angle-of-Attack ([[AOA]]), airspeed ([[Angle of Attack vs Speed.jpeg|image]]), [[Load Factor]] (such as in turn, [[Forces in Level Turn.jpeg|image]]), aircraft configuration, weight, attitude
		1. ![[Angle of Attack Impact to Pressure on Airfoil.jpeg]]
	2. The drag curve and power curve. Flying "behind the power curve". (“pitch for airspeed, power for altitude”)
		1. ![[Drag vs Speed.jpeg]]
		2. ![[Power Required Curve.jpeg]]
	4. Stall warning devices and other indications of impending stall (mushy controls, buffeting)
	5. Difference between attitude and AOA
	6. Environmental elements affecting aircraft performance ([[Hot, High, and Heavy]])
	7. [[Static vs Dynamic Stability and How Trainer Planes Are Designed]]
3. Introduction to [[Weight and Balance]]
	- > [!note] [[WVFC]] requires W&B as part of solo ground review form
4. Slow flight maneuvering
	1. Set Up ([[CHAPS]])
		1. Clear the area - perform clearing turns
		2. Heading - choose a heading and set the heading bug
		3. Altitude - choose a safe altitude and set the bug.
			1. ACS calls for 1500' minimum recovery, but this is too low to start! -- start at > 3000' AGL
			2. Be careful of overlaying Bravo
		4. Position - Identify an emergency landing location
		5. Settings - Reduce power, maintaining altitude while aircraft slows down, extend gear and flaps at appropriate speeds if applicable
	3. Reduce speed to ~5 knots above stall or stall-warning^[Can find this speed by continuing to slow until first indication of stall, then flying at 5kts faster]
	4. Add power as necessary to maintain altitude
	5. Maintain rudder coordination, adjust trim as necessary
	6. S&L, turns, climbs, descents at various configurations (flaps and power)
	7. Emphasize rudder coordination, and divide attention between aircraft control, traffic avoidance, and orientation
	8. Reestablish cruise flight: Full power, reduce pitch, hold altitude as plane accelerates, set cruise power, trim
5.  Aerodynamics of stalls
	1. [[Stall]] occurs at critical angle of attack
	2. Stall can occur at ANY airspeed, attitude, or power setting!
	3. Aircraft designed to pitch down at stall 
		1. ![[Longitudinal Stability.png]]
		2. ![[Effect of Speed on Downwash.jpeg]]
	4. Discuss effect from
		1. Change wing shape
			1. flaps: wing generates more lift, so can fly at lower angle of attack w/ flaps, so lower stall speed
		2. Change wing loading
			1. ![[CL and CG and Tail Down Force.jpeg]]
			2. weight, [[CG]], [[Load Factor]], bank angle, gear
	5. Our airplane stalls from the inside back ([[Stall Progression for Various Wing Platforms.jpeg|regular wing]]), but still ailerons will be less effective in a stall^[See [How Wing Washout Makes Your Airplane More Stable](https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/aircraft-systems/how-wing-washout-makes-your-airplane-and-wings-more-stable-when-flying/) for additional info.]
6. Situations where risk of stalls increase
	1. Landing approach, especially skidding base to final turn
	2. Climb-out, trying to clear an obstacle, especially at high density altitude
	3. Emergency landing, power-off glide, trying to stretch the glide
	4. Exceeding max gross, CG out of limits
	5. Ice or frost accumulation on wings
7. Stall recognition
	1. Sight - high pitch attitude (not always)
	2. Sound - reduced airflow, less wind noise
	3. Feel - mushy controls, less effective, buffeting
8. Power Off Stall Maneuver
	1. Simulates stall during approach to landing
	2. Clearing Turns, ID Emergency Field, Outside Reference ([[CHAPS]])
	3. Enter slow flight in landing configuration
	4. Descend at approach speed
	5. Pitch up slowly for full stall
	6. Verbally acknowledge stall horn
	7. Continue holding pitch to full stall
	8. Recover: pitch down just below horizon, full power, raise flaps one notch, then incrementally up. Climb [[Vy]].
9. Common errors
	1. Poor rudder coordination, drifting off altitude, heading, etc
	2. Using excessive bank angle
	3. Unintentional stall
	4. Improper use of trim
	5. Not maintaining rudder coordination, causing wing to drop during stall, entering spin!
	2. Delay in stall recovery, causing excessive altitude loss or spin entry
	3. Secondary stall due to aggressive pitch up during recovery
