These are example radio calls for an arrival and departure at a non-tower
airport. The exact calls will vary depending on the circumstances. Each call should include your location and altitude, and what you are doing next. If you are on the 45 or downwind, you are assumed to be at pattern altitude, unless you call out something different.

When things are confusing or non-standard, it’s OK to get “conversational” on the frequency to make your intentions clear, but try to keep the calls concise.

1. Initial call, inbound for landing: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie
Sierra, ten miles north east, 3000 feet, inbound for landing, Watsonville”</span>
2. Next call, closer in, when you have determined what runway other traffic is using: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, five miles north east, three thousand feet, will overfly the airport and enter left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville”</span>
3. Crossing overhead: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, overhead at two thousand two hundred feet, turning southbound will enter left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville”</span>
4. After flying outbound for about 2 miles, and descending to pattern
altitude, on the 45 entry: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, left forty five runway two zero, Watsonville”</span>
5. On the downwind: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, left downwind runway two zero, Watsonville”</span>
6. On base leg: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, left base runway two zero, Watsonville”</span>

9. Taxiing for departure: <span class="comm-text">“Watsonville traffic, Cessna six Charlie Sierra, transient parking, taxiing runway two zero via Alpha for departure, Watsonville”</span> (Note: It’s nice to include the taxiway if there are multiple ways to get there.)
