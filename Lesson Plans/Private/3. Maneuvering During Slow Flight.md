### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with maneuvers during slow flight. Understand aerodynamics of slow flight, and develop ability to recognize and recover from impending stall.

### Schedule
`= this.ground-hr` hour ground, `= this.local-dual-hr` hours flight

### Lesson Elements
1. What is slow flight? Why do we practice this?
	1. Flight at high [[AOA]], close to stall, or stall warning
	2. We experience this during takeoffs, landings, go-arounds
2. Aerodynamics of slow flight
	1. Newton and Bernoulli
	3. Angle-of-Attack ([[AOA]]), airspeed, [[load factor]], aircraft configuration, weight, and attitude
	4. The drag curve and power curve. Flying "behind the power curve". 
		1. ![[Power Required Curve.jpeg]]
		2. ![[Drag vs Speed.jpeg]]
	5. Stall warning devices
	6. Difference between attitude and AOA
	7. Environmental elements affecting aircraft performance ([[Hot, High, and Heavy]])
4. Slow flight maneuvering
	1. Altitude limits (ACS calls for 1500' minimum recovery - too low!)
	2. Select practice area, perform clearing turns
	3. Reduce power, maintaining altitude while aircraft slows down, extend gear and flaps at appropriate speeds
	4. Reduce speed to ~5 knots above stall or stall-warning
	5. Add power as necessary to maintain altitude
	6. Maintain rudder coordination, adjust trim as necessary
	7. S&L, turns, climbs, descents at various configurations (flaps and power)
	8. Emphasize rudder coordination, and divide attention between aircraft control, traffic avoidance, and orientation
	9. Reestablish cruise flight: Full power, reduce pitch, hold altitude as plane accelerates, set cruise power, trim
5. Common errors
	1. Poor rudder coordination, drifting off altitude, heading, etc
	2. Using excessive bank angle
	3. Unintentional stall
	4. Improper use of trim

### Completion Standards
Client should be profiecient at entering slow flight, maneuvering, and recovering. During slow flight maneuvers, maintain altitude &plusmn;100feet, heading &plusmn;10 degrees, airspeed +10/-0 knots, bank angle &plusmn;10 degrees.
