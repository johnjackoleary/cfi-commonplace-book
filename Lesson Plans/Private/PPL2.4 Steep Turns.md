### Objective
Develop knowledge of the aerodynamics of steep turns, including load factor and effect on stall speed. Develop [[risk management]] and skills associated with steep turns.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section V.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL1.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 1 hour

### Lesson Elements
1. Aerodynamics of steep turns
	1. [[Adverse yaw]] and rudder usage to compensate for it
	2. Rudder usage during turn entry, steady turn, and turn exit
	3. [[Overbanking Tendency]] -- possibly causing crossed controls during turn
	4. Load factor (g force) varies with bank angle (reciprocal of cosine of bank angle)
	5. Stall speed varies with square root of load factor![[Bank Versus Stall Speed and Load Factor]]
	6. Most light aircraft designed for 3.8 positive g max (corresponds to 75-degree bank level turn)
	7. [[Maneuvering speed]] Va - define and discuss entry speed for steep turn
2. Flying the maneuver
	1. Set-up for maneuvering ([[CHAPS]]), start at [[Va]]
	2. Crisp roll into 45° bank; add power passing ~30°; aft pressure for altitude
	3. Rollout on entry heading
3. Notes
	1. You may notice (subtle) opposite aileron during turn to prevent [[overbanking tendency]]
	2. There's a lot of debate on if you should or shouldn't use trim. I suggest not, but you may want to.
	3. May be ask to do one 360, or two back-to-back
4. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to scan for traffic or locating emergency field
	2. Staring at the instruments too much -- this is easiest to fly just looking outside!
	3. Using airspeed greater than Va
	4. Letting altitude or bank angle drift during turn
	5. Lack of rudder coordination
	6. Not adding power to maintain airspeed
	7. Rolling out on wrong heading

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate location, select a safe entry speed, perform 360° turn in either direction with 45° bank, maintain altitude and add power to maintain airspeed.
