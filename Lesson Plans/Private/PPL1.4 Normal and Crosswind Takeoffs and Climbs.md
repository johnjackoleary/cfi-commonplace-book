### Introduction
During takeoff, a lot happens in a short period of time. The pilot needs to make final configuration changes and checks, taxi with crosswinds in mind, make radio calls, steer with the rudder, confirm engine performance, and be ready to abort if something isn't right. As always, having checklists and following them (in this case, from memory) is very important. In this lesson we'll first look at the aerodynamics of takeoffs (which the examiner expects you to understand), the preparation (do you have enough runway?), and the actual procedure. We'll also talk about how a takeoff in the presence of crosswinds differs.

**Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework:** [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]
**Builds On:** [[PPL1.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]
**Schedule:** 1 hour ground, 2 hour flight, practice every flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Theory
	1. Transferring weight from wheels to wings
	2. Climb Speed: Best Angle ([[Vx]]) or Best Rate ([[Vy]])![[Vy and Vx.jpeg]]
	3. [[Ground Effect]]: Using it, and exiting it
	4. [[Four Left Turning Tendencies]]
	5. How the takeoff reverses the steps of the landing
2. Preparation
	1. Confirm adequate takeoff distance, from aircraft performance charts ([[POH]], section 5)
		1. Consider effects of wind, [[density altitude]], weight, runway surface
3. Normal Takeoffs
	1. Procedure from [[POH]]
	2. Before taking the runway
		1. Go/No-go location picked out ahead of time ([[50-70 Rule]])
		2. Call out rotate and climb speeds
		3. Recite [[Plans for Rejected Takeoff]] (discussed more below)
	3. Taking the runway
		1. Check for traffic
		2. "[[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]"
	4. Ground roll
		1. Feet off brakes / heels on the floor
		2. [[Smooth Power Application]]
		3. Make a last check of instruments (RPM good, oil pressure green, airspeed alive)
		4. Use rudder pedals to maintain directional control.  Right rudder as necessary to offset left-turning tendency, more like flying than taxiing
4. Additional Considerations for Crosswind Takeoffs
	1. [[Crosswind Component]] of wind
	2. Max demo'd crosswind ([[POH]])
	3. Apply full aileron pressure into the crosswind
	4. ![[Crosswind Takeoff.jpeg]]
	5. Transition from side-slip to wings-level crab when out of usable runway
	6. ![[Crosswind Slip to Crab.jpeg]]
6. Normal Climbs 
	1. Climb out at [[Vy]], set trim, correct for wind to maintain runway centerline
	2. No turns below 400'^[Unless required for safety, of course], usually wait to [[TPA]] minus 300'
	3. Awareness of noise abatement rules/recommendations (at Palo Alto, turn right 10 degrees for climb out on 31)
7. Emergency Considerations
	1. [[Plans for Rejected Takeoff]]. Reasons to reject: nose wheel shimmy, engine RPM, something "doesn't feel right", etc
	2. Emergency plans must be in mind BEFORE TAKEOFF
	3. Engine failure on upwind climb below safe altitude -- LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD
	4. Reasons **not** to reject: an open window or door, or anything that can be fixed easily in the air, or after a prompt landing
8. Common Errors
	1. Ignoring crosswind
	2. Drifting from centerline during takeoff roll
	3. Drifting from centerline during climb out

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency and safety for normal takeoffs and climbs, including pre-takeoff checks, traffic awareness, and emergency options.
