### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills required for emergency flight by reference to instruments.

### Resources
- Instrument Flying Handbook ([[IFH]]) Ch 6-7;
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections VIII.A,B,C,D,F

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL1.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hour, Flight/Sim 1 hour, practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations]].

### CFI Equipment
Hood or foggles

### Lesson Elements
1. Introduction to Instrument Scan (ground portion)
	1. Primary/supporting instruments vs. control/performance instruments
	2. Instrument Scan
		1. Control and performance instruments
		2. Instrument cross-check, types of scans
		3. 4-step scan procedure (Butcher) to initiate any maneuver
			1. Set approximate attitude and power
			2. Inverted V-scan to check trends
			3. Scan primary instruments
			4. Scan all instruments
2. Scenarios of particular concern for accidental IMC
	1. Accidentally fly into a cloud -- turn around!
	2. Accidentally trapped above a cloud layer -- go elsewhere to VFR conditions
		1. If unable to go elsewhere, with ATC's help/instructions, establish stable, slow descent through layer
3. Attitude instrument flight basics
	1. Straight and Level flight ([[IFH]] 7-2)
	2. Straight climbs and descents (IFH 7-14)
		1. Pitch-Power-Trim sequence to initiate climb, Power-Pitch-Trim for descent.
	3. Turns (IFH 7-19)
4. Common errors
	1. Spatial disorientation (see [[Illusions Leading to Spatial Disorientation]])
	2. Distraction
	3. Fixation or omission
	4. Multitasking in a turn -- watch the turn, and do nothing else until complete
	5. Heavy touching, over-controlling
	6. Improper trim control

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate basic attitude instrument flying skills, to ACS standards. Maneuvers will include straight-and-level, turn to headings, and perform constant airspeed climbs and descents, by reference to flight instruments only.  Concurrent tasks will include looking up and tuning radio and navigation frequencies.

> [!success]- Tolerances (Partial) from [[Private Pilot ACS|ACS]]
> ±200', heading ±20°, airspeed ±10 knots

### Required Logbook Phraseology
[[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- (e)(12) Control and maneuvering solely by reference to flight instruments, including straight and level flight, turns, descents, climbs, use of radio aids, and ATC directives

[[FAR 61.107 PPL Flight Reqs]]
- (b)(1)(ix) Basic instrument maneuvers

### Required Homework
 None

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly four fundamentals using image of instruments. What do you expect to see changing in each for each maneuver?
