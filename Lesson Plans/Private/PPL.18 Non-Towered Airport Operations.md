### Objective
Develop knowledge of operations and traffic patterns at non-towered airports.

### References
- [[AC 90-66]]

- [[PHAK Ch14]]
- [[AIM 4-3]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section III Task B

### Builds On
- [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL.12 Flying the Traffic Pattern and Go-Arounds]]
- [[PPL.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
2 hours ground, 1 hour flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Pre-Flight
	1. Sources for airport information and data (chart supplements, [[EFB]]), [[NOTAM|NOTAMs]]
		1. Traffic Pattern Altitude ([[TPA]])
	2. Non-towered airport frequencies: [[Unicom]], [[CTAF]]
	3. Tower airports become non-towered when tower closed
	4. Weather sources: [[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]], 1800wxbrief.com, telephone
	5. Airport markings
		1. Segment circle, pattern indicators ![[Segmented Circle.jpeg]]
		3. Wind indicators: sock, tees, tetrahedrons ![[Wind Direction Indicators.jpeg]]
		4. Runway and taxi markings - See [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
	6. Airport lighting
		1. Airport beacons ![[Rotating Beacon.jpeg]]
		3. Pilot controlled lighting
		4. Glidepath systems 
			1. ![[VASI.jpeg]]
			2. ![[PAPI.jpeg]]
2. Non-towered airport operations
	1. Pattern Planning and Entry
		1. Determining the [[Active Runway]]
		2. Planning pattern entry (and use of tools like ForeFlight)
			1. Overhead entries, and standard 45-degree entry to traffic patterns
			2.  ![[Non-Towered Pattern Entry.jpeg]]
			3. Straight-Ins? Not illegal, but not usually a good idea
		3. Traffic Pattern and Departure
			1. Standard traffic patterns to the left, unless charts indicate Right traffic (See "RP 31" for KPAO on sectional)
				1. All turns must be to the left (or right, if right traffic) while in pattern! ([[FAR 91.126]])
				2. ![[Single Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
			2. Parallel runway operations (see [[AIM 4-3]]) ![[Parallel Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
	2. [[Radio Usage at Non-Towered Airports]]
	3. Some aircraft don't have radios
	4. Reminder of safety considerations from [[PPL.13 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]] ([[Wake Turbulence]], [[FAR 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules|Right-of-Way Rules]], [[Runway Incursions]], awareness of other operations, etc)
3. Common errors
	1. Forgetting radio calls
	2. Selecting wrong runway or inappropriate entry procedure to pattern
	3. Lack of awareness of other aircraft


### Completion Standards
Client should demonstrate knowledge of non-towered airport operations, including obtaining pre-flight information, airport markings, traffic pattern procedures, radio communications, and awareness of other aircraft.

### Required Homework
- [ ] Read [[AC 90-66]]

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly entry to non-towered airport, from several directions and various wind, with radio calls
