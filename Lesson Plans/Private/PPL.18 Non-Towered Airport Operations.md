### Objective
Develop knowledge of operations and traffic patterns at non-towered airports, including how to arrive and depart the area of the airport.

### Resources
- [AOPA's "Operations at Nontowered Airports"](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/files/aopa/home/pilot-resources/asi/safety-advisors/sa08.pdf) #safety-advisors from [[Air Safety Institute]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section III.B
- [[Non-Tower Radio Communications Examples]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL.12 Flying the Traffic Pattern and Go-Arounds]]
- [[PPL.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
Ground 2 hours, 1 hour sim/flight

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons PPL [[PPL.18 Non-Towered Airport Operations|18]], [[PPL.19 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|19]], [[PPL.20 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|20]], [[PPL.21 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|21]], & [[PPL.22 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|22]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. Pre-Flight
	1. Sources for airport information and data (chart supplements, [[EFB]], [[AOPA]]), [[NOTAM|NOTAMs]]
		1. Traffic Pattern Altitude ([[TPA]])
		2. Noise Abatement
	2. Non-towered airport frequencies: [[Unicom]], [[CTAF]]
	3. Tower airports become non-towered when tower closed
	4. Weather sources: [[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]], 1800wxbrief.com, telephone
	5. Airport markings
		1. Segment circle, pattern indicators ![[Segmented Circle.jpeg]]
		3. Wind indicators: [[Wind Sock]], tees, tetrahedrons ![[Wind Direction Indicators.jpeg]]
		4. Runway and taxi markings - See [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
	6. Airport lighting
		1. Airport beacons (white/green: land+civilian, white/white/green: military)
		3. Pilot controlled lighting
		4. Glidepath systems 
			1. VASI![[VASI.jpeg]]
			2. PAPI![[PAPI.jpeg]]
2. Non-towered airport operations
	1. Pattern Planning and Entry
		1. Computing [[TOD]]: [[Stabilized Approach|3-1 Principle]] or assume 500 [[FPM]]
		2. Determining the [[Active Runway]]
		3. Planning pattern entry (and use of tools like ForeFlight)
			1. Overhead entries, and standard 45-degree entry to traffic patterns
			2.  ![[Non-Towered Pattern Entry.jpeg]]
			3. Straight-Ins? Not illegal, but not usually a good idea
		4. Traffic Pattern
			1. Standard traffic patterns to the left, unless charts indicate Right traffic (See "RP 31" for KPAO on sectional)
				1. All turns must be to the left (or right, if right traffic) while in pattern! ([[FAR 91.126 Class G Airport Ops]])
				2. ![[Single Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
			2. Parallel runway operations (see [[AIM 4-3]]) ![[Parallel Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
	3. Arriving to airport area and [[Non-Tower Radio Communications Examples]]
		1. "The Active" runway
		2. Some aircraft don't have radios
	4. Departing the traffic pattern and airport
		1. [[FAA]] endorses only straight-out or 45-degree (L/R matching pattern direction) departure
		2. Be aware, individuals sometimes depart from crosswind or downwind leg
		3. Turn enroute when clear of pattern
	5. Reminder of safety considerations from [[PPL.13 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]] ([[Wake Turbulence]], [[FAR 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules|Right-of-Way Rules]], [[Runway Incursion]], awareness of other operations, etc)
3. Overview of Flight Planners / Navigation Logs
	1. Used to record key information pertinent to a flight
	2. Done by hand
		1. Consider [ASA](https://asa2fly.com/flight-planner-pad/) or [Jeppesen](https://www.amazon.com/Jeppesen-VFR-Navigation-Log-JS436183/dp/B003VSCCJ0/ref=sr_1_36?keywords=JEPPESEN&qid=1703037416&sr=8-36)
		2. Print a comparable one online in [horizontal](https://www.dauntless-soft.com/products/Freebies/VFRFlightPlanner/)^[Version B seems to align best with flow from [[E6B]] instructions] or [vertical](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/za5mbd/comment/iykckje/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
	3. Done electronically
		1. [Calculator with manual input](https://e6bx.com/navlog/)
		2. Generated with info like forecasted winds from [[ForeFlight]], [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com/), or others
5. Common errors
	1. Forgetting radio calls
	2. Selecting wrong runway or inappropriate entry procedure to pattern
	3. Lack of awareness of other aircraft

### Completion Standards
Client should demonstrate knowledge of non-towered airport operations, including obtaining pre-flight information, airport markings, traffic pattern procedures, radio communications, and awareness of other aircraft.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Traffic pattern procedures that include area departure, area arrival, entry into the traffic pattern, and approach
