### Objective
Develop knowledge of operations and traffic patterns at non-towered airports.

### Resources
- [AOPA's "Operations at Nontowered Airports"](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/files/aopa/home/pilot-resources/asi/safety-advisors/sa08.pdf) #safety-advisors from [[Air Safety Institute]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section III Task B
- [[Non-Tower Radio Communications Examples]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL.12 Flying the Traffic Pattern and Go-Arounds]]
- [[PPL.7 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
1.5 hours ground, 1.5 hour sim/flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Pre-Flight
	1. Sources for airport information and data (chart supplements, [[EFB]], [[AOPA]]), [[NOTAM|NOTAMs]]
		1. Traffic Pattern Altitude ([[TPA]])
		2. Noise Abatement
	2. Non-towered airport frequencies: [[Unicom]], [[CTAF]]
	3. Tower airports become non-towered when tower closed
	4. Weather sources: [[AWOS]]/[[ASOS]], 1800wxbrief.com, telephone
	5. Airport markings
		1. Segment circle, pattern indicators ![[Segmented Circle.jpeg]]
		3. Wind indicators: [[Wind Sock]], tees, tetrahedrons ![[Wind Direction Indicators.jpeg]]
		4. Runway and taxi markings - See [[PPL.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
	6. Airport lighting
		1. Airport beacons (white/green: land+civilian, white/white/green: military)
		3. Pilot controlled lighting
		4. Glidepath systems 
			1. VASI![[VASI.jpeg]]
			2. PAPI![[PAPI.jpeg]]
2. Non-towered airport operations
	1. Pattern Planning and Entry
		1. Determining the [[Active Runway]]
		2. Planning pattern entry (and use of tools like ForeFlight)
			1. Overhead entries, and standard 45-degree entry to traffic patterns
			2.  ![[Non-Towered Pattern Entry.jpeg]]
			3. Straight-Ins? Not illegal, but not usually a good idea
		3. Traffic Pattern and Departure
			1. Standard traffic patterns to the left, unless charts indicate Right traffic (See "RP 31" for KPAO on sectional)
				1. All turns must be to the left (or right, if right traffic) while in pattern! ([[FAR 91.126 Class G Airport Ops]])
				2. ![[Single Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
			2. Parallel runway operations (see [[AIM 4-3]]) ![[Parallel Runway Traffic.jpeg]]
	2. Arriving to airport area and [[Non-Tower Radio Communications Examples]]
		1. "The Active" runway
		2. Some aircraft don't have radios
	3. Reminder of safety considerations from [[PPL.13 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]] ([[Wake Turbulence]], [[FAR 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules|Right-of-Way Rules]], [[Runway Incursion]], awareness of other operations, etc)
3. Common errors
	1. Forgetting radio calls
	2. Selecting wrong runway or inappropriate entry procedure to pattern
	3. Lack of awareness of other aircraft


### Completion Standards
Client should demonstrate knowledge of non-towered airport operations, including obtaining pre-flight information, airport markings, traffic pattern procedures, radio communications, and awareness of other aircraft.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Traffic pattern procedures that include area departure, area arrival, entry into the traffic pattern, and approach
- Procedures and operating practices for collision avoidance, wake turbulence precautions, and windshear avoidance

### Required Homework
- [ ] Read [[AC 90-66]]
- [ ] Purchase items from [[PPL.C When to Acquire Various Equipment]]

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly entry to non-towered airport, from several directions and various wind, with radio calls
