### Objective
Develop skills and procedures to identify aircraft location, with on-board charts or equipment or with ATC help, and plan diversion to an appropriate alternate airport.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections VI.C (diversion) and VI.D (lost procedures)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]
- [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]
- [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]
- [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hour, Flight 1 hour, frequent practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations]].

### Lesson Elements
1. Lost procedures
	1. Might be appropriate to circle and/or gain altitude for better view of landmarks. Some use the 5 C's: Climb, Circle, Conserve (fuel), Confess, Communicate/Comply
	2. Use of charts and pilotage to find location
	3. Use of GPS nearest airport feature, or triangulation using VORs
	4. How to get ATC assistance, and what frequency to use
2. Plan diversion to alternate airport
	1. Use of GPS direct-to feature
	2. Use of VOR navigation, such as crossing VOR radials
	3. Use of charts (paper or electronic) to estimate distance and heading to alternate
	4. Heading, distance, time estimate, and fuel estimate to alternate airport
		1. Rules of thumb are fine
		2. Don't choose a heading that flies into a mounating 
3. In-flight practice / checkride
	1. CFI will get learner "lost", typically after maneuvering with the hood during simulated instrument flight, and perhaps turning off location services on the learner's iPad
		1. Or, they will declare someone is sick and needs to land immediately
		2. Or they'll simply say "take me to Auburn"
	2. Learner will demonstrate ability to find location, plan route to an alternate airport, and fly to and land at alternate
4. The checkride
	1. The examiner will introduce one of the problems listed above
	2. They will want to hear four specific things: heading, distance, time estimate, and fuel estimate
	3. Then you should turn to that heading, start to execute the new plan, and refine your planning, until told otherwise.

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to use multiple means to identify location, and to plan route to an alternate airport, including estimate of distance, time, and fuel usage to the alternate.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Emergency procedures^[Also in [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations]]]

### Required Homework
- [ ] Schedule pre-solo xc phase check, if required

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Many GPS devices have a free simulator to practice with, which is useful to build proficiency
