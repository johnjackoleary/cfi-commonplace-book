### Objective
Develop skills and procedures to identify aircraft location, with on-board charts or equipment or with ATC help, and plan diversion to an appropriate alternate airport.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections VI.C (diversion) and VI.D (lost procedures)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]
- [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]
- [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]
- [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts, National Airspace System, and Intro to FARs]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hour, Flight 1 hour, frequent practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations]].

### Lesson Elements
1. Lost procedures
	1. Might be appropriate to circle and/or gain altitude for better view of landmarks. Some use the [[Lost Procedures (5 C's)|5 C's]]: Confess, Climb, Circle, Conserve (fuel), Communicate/Comply
	2. Use of charts and pilotage to find location
	3. Use of [[GPS]] nearest airport feature, or triangulation using [[VOR]]s
	4. How to get [[ATC]] assistance, and what frequency to use
2. Plan diversion to alternate airport
	1. Use of GPS direct-to feature
	2. Use of VOR navigation, such as crossing VOR radials
	3. Use of charts (paper or electronic) to estimate distance and heading to alternate
	4. Heading, groundspeed, time estimate, and fuel estimate to alternate airport
		1. Time estimate will require a distance, likely
		2. Ensure a heading will actually work. For example, that it doesn't fly into terrain or obstacles
		3. Rules of thumb are fine
			1. Heading
				1. Turning to a rough heading initially is fine, e.g. "generally south", so you're at least not flying further away
				2. [[VOR]] compass roses can give you a quick estimate of magnetic heading^[This is not actually aligned with magnetic north, since VORs are fixed and the north pole moves. But it's pretty close.]
			2. Groundspeed
				1. You should know your expected GS from your flight planning. If not, estimate.
				2. Convenient rounding can help make this much easier to estimate time^[E.g. round down from 100kts to 90kts]
			3. Distances / Time Estimate
				1. Some folks memorize how long the distance from their thumb to index finger is in NM on the sectional/TAC
				2. Use of the notches along a line of longitude also gives NM at a glance
			4. Fuel Estimate
				1. Use a worst case fuel burn to find the fuel required
				2. Compare to your fuel remaining, either from your navlog or using the fuel gauges.
		4. Use of 'two finger pinch' on [[ForeFlight]] or a [[GPS]] is totally fine for this, and likely much more accurate and efficient
3. In-flight practice
	1. CFI will get learner "lost", typically after maneuvering with the hood during simulated instrument flight, and perhaps turning off location services on the learner's iPad
		1. Or, they will declare someone is sick and needs to land immediately
		2. Or they'll simply say "take me to Auburn"
	2. Learner will demonstrate ability to find location, plan route to an alternate airport, and fly to and land at alternate
4. The checkride
	1. The examiner will introduce one of the problems listed above
	2. They will want to hear four specific things: heading, groundspeed, time estimate, and fuel estimate^[These are listed in the [[Private Pilot ACS]]]
	3. Then you should turn to that heading, start to execute the new plan, and refine your planning, until told otherwise.

### Completion Standards
Client should be able to use multiple means to identify location, and to plan route to an alternate airport, including estimate of distance, time, and fuel usage to the alternate.

> [!success]- Tolerances (Partial) from [[Private Pilot ACS|ACS]]
> **Lost Procedures**: 
> - determine position
> - select an appropriate course of action
>   
> **Diversion**: 
> - make a reasonable estimate of heading, groundspeed, arrival time, and fuel required
> - promptly divert
> - alt ±200'; hdg ±15°

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.93 Solo XC Reqs]]:
- Emergency procedures^[Also in [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations]]]

### Required Homework
- [ ] Schedule pre-solo xc phase check, if required

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Many GPS devices have a free simulator to practice with, which is useful to build proficiency
