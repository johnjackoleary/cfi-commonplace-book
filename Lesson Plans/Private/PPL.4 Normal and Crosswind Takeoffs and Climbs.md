### Objective
Understand and become proficient at the procedures used for normal/crosswind takeoffs and climbs. 

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec IV
- [[POH]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 2 hour flight, practice every flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Theory
	1. Transferring weight from wheels to wings
	2. Climb Speed: Best Angle ([[Vx]]) or Best Rate ([[Vy]])![[Vy and Vx.jpeg]]
	3. [[Ground Effect]]
	4. Takeoff distance from aircraft performance charts ([[POH]], section V)
		1. Effect of wind, [[density altitude]], weight, runway surface
	6. [[Four Left Turning Tendencies]]
2. Normal Takeoffs
	1. Procedure from [[POH]]
	2. Pre-Takeoff
		1. Go/No-go location picked out ahead of time ([[50-70 Rule]]
		2. Call out rotate and climb speeds
		3. Recite [[Plans for Rejected Takeoff]] (discussed more below)
	3. Taking the runway -- Check for traffic, and "[[Lights, Camera, Action, Time]]"
	4. Setting controls for cross-wind
	5. Feet off brakes, [[Smooth Power Application|gentle power application]], last check of instruments (RPM good, oil pressure grean, airspeed alive)
	6. Rudder pedals to maintain directional control, right rudder as necessary to offset left-turning tendency, more like flying than taxiing
3. Crosswind Takeoffs
	1. Crosswind component of wind
	3. Max demo'd crosswind ([[POH]])
	2. Transition from side-slip to wings-level crab when out of usable runway
	3. ![[Crosswind Takeoff.jpeg]]
	4. ![[Crosswind Slip to Crab.jpeg]]
5. Normal Climbs 
	1. Climb out at [[Vy]], set trim, correct for wind to maintain runway centerline
	2. No turns below 400'^[Unless required for safety, of course], usually wait to [[TPA]]-300'
	3. Awareness of noise abatement rules/recommendations (at Palo Alto, turn right 10 degrees for climb out on 31)
6. Emergency Considerations
	1. [[Plans for Rejected Takeoff]]. Reasons to reject: nose wheel shimmy, engine RPM, something "doesn't feel right", etc
	2. Emergency plans must be in mind BEFORE TAKEOFF
	3. Engine failure on upwind climb below safe altitude -- LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD
7. Common Errors
	1. Ignoring crosswind
	2. Drifting from centerline during takeoff roll
	3. Drifting from centerline during climb out

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.87 Student Solo Reqs]]: 
- Takeoffs, including normal and crosswind

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency and safety for normal takeoffs and climbs, including pre-takeoff checks, traffic awareness, and emergency options.

### Required Homework
 - [ ] Read through [[POH]] Section 4

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly takeoffs
- [ ] Rehearse [[Plans for Rejected Takeoff]]
