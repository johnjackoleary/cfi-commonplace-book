### Objective
Develop knowledge of towered airport traffic patterns, skill and judgement in approaching and departing various types of patterns, and good procedures while flying the pattern.

### References
- [[AFH Ch8]]
- [[AIM 4-3]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec III

### Builds On
- [[5. Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[7. Ground Reference Maneuvers]]

### CFI Equipment
GPS/Sentry/ADS-B In

### Schedule
1-hour ground, 1.5 hours flight

### Lesson Elements
1. Review charted information on Sectionals, Chart Supplements, other information sources
2. Towered Airport (Palo Alto traffic procedures as example)
	1. Pattern altitude: 800' on east side, 1000' on west side
	2. Approaching from west: maintain 1500' until crossing 101 freeway
	3. Standard Right Traffic for runway 31, turn right 10 degrees after departure for noise abatement
	4. Common departures: Left and Right Dumbarton, 270 overhead
	5. Visual Reporting points for calling in to KPAO, SLAC, Woodside VOR, Windy Hill, Leslie Salt, Coyote Hills, Sunol Pass, etc....
	6. Flying the pattern -- memorize power settings/airspeeds, use wind correction angle like [[Maneuver - Rectangular Course|rectangular course]]
5. Other safety concerns
	1. Collision Avoidance
		1. [[Right of Way Rules]]
		2. Awareness of other operations, such as parachuting
	2. [[Wake turbulence]] from helicopters, and heavy aircraft
	3. [[Windshear]] avoidance
6. Common Errors
	1. Lack of planning ahead, staying ahead of the airplane
	2. Lack of situation awareness or awareness of other traffic
	3. Improper radio usage, forgetting radio calls at non-towered airports

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency at planning and flying pattern approaches and departures, at towered and non-towered airports, complying with AIM recommended procedures, maintaining awareness of and proper spacing from other aircraft. Maintain traffic pattern altitude ±100 feet, and airspeed ±10 knots (or mph).
