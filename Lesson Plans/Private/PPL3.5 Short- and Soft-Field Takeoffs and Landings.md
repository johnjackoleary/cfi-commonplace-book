### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills for soft-field (unpaved) takeoffs and landings, and short-field takeoffs and landings.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections IV.E&F (Short Field) and IV.C&D (Soft Field)
- [[Commercial ACS]] Sections IV.E&F (Short Field) and IV.C&D (Soft Field)

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.4 Normal and Crosswind Takeoffs and Climbs]]
- [[PPL3.2 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.0; Flight – multiple flights, with frequent practice

### Lesson Elements
Overview of short- and soft-field operations
- When would we use these?
- What if a field is both short and soft?

#### Short-Field
1. Takeoff
	1. Set flaps according to POH/AFM
	2. Position flight controls for existing wind conditions
	3. Taxi into takeoff position using maximum available runway length, and align on runway centerline
	4. Apply brakes and hold while applying takeoff power, check gauges
	5. Release brakes, accelerate with POH recommended pitch technique, rotate at recommended [[IAS]], and accelerate to and climb at [[Vx]]
	6. Retract gear/flaps after positive rate of climb, clear of obstacles and >200', and in accordance with POH/AFM
	7. Maintain [[Vx]] until obstacle is cleared (or 50' AGL), then accelerate to [[Vy]]
	8. Here's how **NOT** to do it:

2. Landing
	1. Complete pre-landing checklist ([[GUMPS]])
	2. Identify touchdown target (200' zone for Private Pilot; 100' zone for Commercial Pilot)
	3. Establish [[POH]]-recommended approach configuration and airspeed, adjust pitch and power as required
	4. Maintain stabilized approach and recommended airspeed (not more than 1.3Vso), applying [[gust factor]] (add half of gust difference)
	5. Aim for a point 200-300 feet short of target ([[Stabilized Approach.jpeg]])
	6. If you're not stabilized, **go around**
	7. Touch down smoothly at or beyond target, with minimal float, at or within 200 feet (PPL) or 100' (CPL) beyond the specified touchdown point
	8. Raise flaps, apply brakes and elevator back-pressure as necessary to stop in the shortest distance consistent with safety, using proper control deflections for existing wind conditions

#### Soft-Field
1. Takeoff
	1. Set flaps according to POH/AFM
	2. Position flight controls for existing wind conditions
	3. Elevator aft for light nose wheel
	4. Taxi into takeoff position without stopping, with smooth power application for takeoff
	5. Establish pitch attitude to rapidly transfer weight from wheels to wings
	6. Lift off at lowest possible airspeed, accelerate to [[Vx]] or [[Vy]] in [[Ground Effect]]
	7. Establish pitch attitude and airspeed for [[Vx]] or [[Vy]] climb
	8. Retract gear/flaps after positive rate of climb, clear of obstacles and >200', and in accordance with POH/AFM
2. Landing
	1. Complete pre-landing checklist ([[GUMPS]])
	2. Establish POH-recommended approach and landing configuration (flaps) and airspeed
	3. Maintain stabilized approach and recommended airspeed (not more than 1.3Vso), applying [[Gust Factor]] (add half of gust difference) +10/-5 knots
	4. Make smooth roundout and flare, with minimum sink rate. Use power as necessary to cushion descent and touchdown. ([[Stabilized Approach.jpeg]])
	5. Maintain full up elevator during rollout, and exit the runway without stopping and safe taxi speed, using proper control deflections for existing wind conditions.  Brakes may not be required. Power may be used to keep from bogging down, and to keep the nose wheel unweighted.

### Completion Standards
Client should demonstrate ability to perform short- and soft-field takeoffs and landings to ACS standards.

> [!success]- Tolerances (Partial) from [[Private Pilot ACS|ACS]]
> - **Short Field Takeoff**: Hold brakes, add full power; Check gauges, release brakes; Rotate per POH; Climb at V<sub>X</sub> +10/-5kt until at least 50' AGL.
> - **Short Field Landing**: Land w/in 200' of specified point; parallel, centerline, nose up, no drift
> - **Soft Field Takeoff**: Taxi w/ minimal braking and no stops; Liftoff early; Accelerate in ground effect; At V<sub>X</sub> or V<sub>Y</sub> start climb
> - **Soft Field Landing**: Minimum sink, parallel, centerline, nose up, no drift; elevator back through exit

### Required Homework
- [ ] Complete solo quiz

### Recommended Homework
