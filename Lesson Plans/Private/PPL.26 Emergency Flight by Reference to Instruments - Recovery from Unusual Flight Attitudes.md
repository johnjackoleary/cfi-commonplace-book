### Objective
Develop knowledge and skill in recognition of and recovery from unusual attitudes, will full- and partial-panel operations.

### References
IFH Ch 7

### Builds On
[[PPL.23 Emergency Flight by Reference to Instruments - Four Fundamentals]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hour, sim/airplane 1.5 hours

### CFI Equipment
Hood or foggles

### Lesson Elements
1. Causes of unusual flight attitudes
	1. Failure to properly trim the controls
	2. Distraction, or fixation
	3. Turbulence and wake turbulence
2. Unusual attitude recoveries (IFH 7-26)
	1. Unusual attitudes are those not normally required during instrument flight. Recovery includes prompt return to straight and level flight
	2. Full panel recoveries
	3. Partial panel recoveries
3. Recognize nose-high unusual attitude
	1. ASI slow or decreasing repidly
	2. VSI shows climb, altimeter shows climb
	3. TC shows turn
	4. Recovery:
		1. Power-Pitch-Bank (must become 2nd nature!)
		2. Full-power - Pitch Down - Level Wings
4. Recognize nose-low unusual attitude
	1. ASI fast or increasing rapidly
	2. VSI negative rate, altimeter shows descent
	3. TC shows turn
	4. Recovery:
		1. Power-Bank-Pitch (must become second nature!)
		2. Reduce power - Level Wings - Pitch Up
5. Common Errors
	1. Failure to recognize unusual attitude
	2. Dependency on sense other than instrument indications
	3. Failure to use proper recovery sequence, i.d. power-pitch-bank for nose-high, and power-bank-pitch for nose low

### Completion Standards
Student demonstrates the ability to recognize, confirm, and recover from unusual attitudes, applying the appropriate pitch, bank, and power corrections in the correct sequence to return the aircraft to a stabilized level flight attitude.

### Required Homework
 
- [ ] Memorize and rehearse recovery from nose-high and nose-low

### Recommended Homework
None
