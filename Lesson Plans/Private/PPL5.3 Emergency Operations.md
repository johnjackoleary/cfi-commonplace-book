> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL3.4 Emergency Landings]]
- [[PPL2.6 Aircraft Systems]]

### Schedule

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as [[PPL5.1 Emergency Flight by Instruments - Four Fundamentals]] or [[PPL5.4 Lost Procedures and Diversion to Alternates]].

### Lesson Elements
> [!summary]
> Though rare, emergencies have a variety of causes and can occur in any phase of flight.
> 
> Some emergencies require immediate action. Others you can debug and resolve using your understanding of aircraft systems. If you can't resolve an issue, it's important to know its impact when deciding to continue or terminate your flight.
> 
> This lesson is intended to help you handle various issues and emergencies. Visualize yourself at each stage of flight below and how you'd approach the situation mentioned.

#### Handling Emergencies
1. [[FAR 91.3 PIC Responsibility and Authority]]
2. What is an emergency? When should you declare one?
	1. When the outcome of the flight is in doubt
	2. When you need higher priority handling from ATC
3. MAYDAY (distress) vs PAN-PAN (urgency)
	1. Both should be said 3x
4. [7 Tips For A Perfect Departure Briefing](https://www.boldmethod.com/blog/lists/2024/07/seven-tips-for-a-perfect-departure-briefing/) from [[Bold Method]]

> [!quote] From [[AIM 6]]
> Pilots who become apprehensive for their safety for any reason should _request assistance immediately._

#### Oh no! Something is Wrong!
> [!note]
> - "**(POH)**" means most POHs have a specific procedure for this emergency.  When that procedure exists, you should follow it -- and in many cases, memorize it. The steps after "**(POH)**" summarize the high-level purpose of the POH procedure.
> - *Procedures in italics* are a reference to [[PPL5.3 Emergency Operations#Key Procedures in Emergencies]] below.

- On the ground...
	- Fire!
		- **(POH)** Keep cranking to suck flames back into the engine; cut off fuel to the engine; grab fire extinguisher; evacuate
- During takeoff...
	- Fire!
		- **(POH)** Can you abort takeoff?  Abort takeoff.
		- Else, take off, and land straight out
	- Engine Failure!
		- **(POH)** Abort takeoff, or forced landing straight ahead.^[[Cub Theatre: The-Not-That-Impossible Turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byBh1Qd6IgA) from [[Paul Bertorelli]] of [[AVweb]]]
		- See also takeoff brief
	- Airspeed isn't alive
		- Abort takeoff, or fly the pattern and land normally
	- A door opens
		- Abort takeoff if safely able
		- Else takeoff normally, deal with it in the air, or land normally
- In the air...
	- Fire!  Where?
		- Engine cowling?
			- **(POH)** Cut off fuel flow; *Emergency Descent and Forced Landing*; pros/cons of turning off master switch
		- Inside the dashboard (probably electrical) or cabin?
			- **(POH)** Master and stby switches off; turn off cabin heat/air; deploy fire extinguisher
				- Fire extinguished? - open windows to clear smoke; if required, follow *procedure to re-power some items*; *Precautionary Landing*
				- Not extinguished? - *Emergency Descent*
		- Wing?
			- **(POH)** Turn wing lights, taxi/landing lights, and pitot heat off; sideslip to keep flames away from fuel tank; *Precautionary landing*
	- Burning smell! (Possible electrical fire)
		- **(POH)** Master and stby switches off; optionally follow *procedure to re-power some items*
	- Engine failure!
		- **(POH)** Best glide; aim for landing spot; attempt restart; Else declare emergency and execute *Forced Landing* ([[ABCDE]])
	- Engine running poorly!
		- Identify a landing spot and navigate toward it; Climb if possible, to store energy; Debug the problem, but be prepared for a *Forced Landing*
		- Possible problems (usually part of the restart checklist) include:
			- Carburetor icing - Add carb heat [[How and Why Carburetor Ice Forms]]
			- Bad mixture/throttle settings - Adjust
			- Fuel pump failure - Turn on backup pump
			- Fuel tank running dry - Switch tanks
			- Ignition switch in 'L' or 'R' - Switch to 'both'
	- Electrical failure
		- The plane still flies; use backup radio or call on cell phone; land as soon as practical
	- Radio failure (you can't hear them, or they can't hear you)
		- [[Squawk 7600]]; proceed to destination if safe; call tower/[[TRACON]] on cell phone if able ([[ATC Phone Numbers]]); look for light signals
	- Instruments don't seem to be reading correctly
		- Are the altimeter and VSI "stuck" even when you change altitude?
			- **(POH)** Static source is blocked; try alternate static source
		- Does airspeed vary with altitude?
			- Pitot tube is blocked
		- Are the vacuum-powered instruments dead? (Which ones are they in your plane?)
			- Vacuum pump (pumps?) is inop
		- [[PFD]] failure
			- Use reversionary mode to display critical instruments on the MFD
	- Plane isn't handling correctly
		- Debug if control surfaces have failed, or flaps aren't extending, or one is stuck
		- **(POH)** Learn to control the plane with what you have; don't forget trim can help; make a *precautionary landing*
	- Low oil pressure - **(POH)** Could lead to engine failure. Watch for oil temperature rise to confirm not a instrument error. *Precautionary Landing*
	- Low fuel - Divert to alternate to refuel
	- Alternator failure - **(POH)** Shed as much electric load as possible; cycle master; estimate time available; land accordingly. 
	- Retractable gear malfunction - (out of scope for this lesson)
	- Flew into a cloud, or lost minimum VFR visibility
		- Rely on [[PPL5.1 Emergency Flight by Instruments - Four Fundamentals]] skills; reverse course; request help on the radio, use your [[Autopilot Systems and Usage|autopilot]]
	- Icing - **(POH)** Reverse course or choose a different altitude; request help on the radio; deploy all anti-ice measures.  See POH for landing with heavy ice accumulation
		- What are the anti- or de-icing systems in this aircraft?^[Consider pitot heat, alternate air intake, and window heat to defrost.]
	- Door or window opens in flight
		- Not an emergency. Close it, or land normally.

#### Key Procedures in Emergencies
These are the emergency procedures referenced in the section above.

1. *Emergency Descent*
	- Goal is to rapidly descend for emergency landing, and possibly put the fire out.
	- **(POH)**
		- Cut off fuel flow
		- Start descent with 30°-45° bank, airspeed >= 100kts.  Bank away from the fire so the flames don't cover the windshield
		- Once fire is out, execute Forced Landing.  See [[PPL3.4 Emergency Landings]]
2. *Forced Landing*
	- **(POH)** See [[PPL3.4 Emergency Landings]]
3. *Precautionary Landing*
	- Assumes engine power is available
	- See **(POH)** procedure
5. *Powering Up Critical Items After an Electrical Fire or Burning Smell*
	- **(POH)** Turn off the master and stby switches.  Turn off all electrical switches.  Note any popped breakers, but do not reset. Turn on the master.  Turn on electrical switches for avionics or other required equipment, one at a time, waiting for signs of burning.

#### Other important topics for emergencies
1. Emergency equipment and survival gear
	1. [[ACS]] IX.C mentions: [[ELT]].  Fire extinguisher operation. Survival gear (food, water, shelter). Overwater operations.
2. Emergency squawk codes: [[Squawk 7700]], [[Squawk 7600]], [[Squawk 7500]]
	1. [[Squawk Code Memory Aid]]
> [!caution] Even passing through one of these codes will trigger an alert for [[ATC]]. As you set a squawk code, be mindful to not pass through one accidentally.
3. [[Intercept Procedures]]
4. Ballistic parachutes
5. Auto-land systems and Garmin Smart Glide

> [!tip] Checkride Tip
> On the checkride, the examiner wants to see you demonstrate a *Forced Landing* and an *Emergency Descent*.  They'll trigger these scenarios by saying something like:
> - "Oops, you just lost the engine"  => Your cue to demonstrate a *Forced Landing* ([[PPL3.4 Emergency Landings]])
> - "I see flames on the right side of the cowling"
> 	- This is your cue to demonstrate an *Emergency Descent*
> 	- If the examiner then says "the flames are out", transition to a *Forced Landing*
> 
> > [!note]
> A forced landing maneuver is a no-go-around maneuver per DPE instruction, however, never risk safety of flight to try and salvage a maneuver.

#### Common errors
1. Failure to use flow patterns or memory items
2. Failure to have checklists handy for quick access
3. Failure to use checklists, or improper use
