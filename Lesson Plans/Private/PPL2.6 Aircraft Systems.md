### Objective
Learner understands the primary aircraft systems, how they work, and how they can fail.

### Resources
- [[AFM]]/[[POH]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section I.G
- [Inside a Single-Engine Aircraft | How a Cessna 172 Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvCv2SuKCE8)^[Not all pronunciations here are correct, but the overview itself is good]
- Many videos from [ERAU Private Pilot (P.A.C.E.)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-5QlDZlK74GrL0fb6V_FZSLX86V9A7j4) by [[ERAU SpecialVFR]]
- [C172 Electrical System Interactive Tool](https://mediafiles.aero.und.edu/aero.und.edu/aviation/trainers/c172s-electrical-system/) from [[UND]]

### Builds On
-[[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]


### Schedule
3 hour ground (can be completed more quickly with good preparation)

### Lesson Elements 
1. Aircraft Instruments
	1. Pitot-Static System ([Pitot-Static Instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdFGbUouE_4) from [[ERAU SpecialVFR]])
		1. Ram air vs. static air
		2. Airspeed
		3. Altimeter
		4. Vertical Speed Indicator
		5. Pitot-Static Failures
			1. Use and impact of alternative static usage^[Jack always struggled to remember how alternate static impacted static pressure. Recently, he heard a story of an old, disagreeable man who owned a lake resort. He wanted his ashes to be scattered over the lake, so when he died, they took a small plane and poured out the ashes. But, since the air pressure in the cabin is lower than outside, all the ashes were pulled back into the airplane. Thus he continued to be a pain even after death. Also, alternate static inside the cabin is lower than normal pressure outside.]
			2. Pitot Heat
	2. Gyroscopic ([Gyroscopic Instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVsx4XWafXg) from [[ERAU SpecialVFR]])

	3. Ignition
		1. [[Magneto]]s
		2. Spark Plugs
			1. Risk of carbon buildup
			2. How to 'burn off' in a failed magneto check
		3. Ignition Switch
	4. Starter^[Often colocated with the ignition, but a different system]
	5. Induction
		1. Filter
		2. Alternate air
	6. Exhaust
	7. Propeller: fixed or variable pitch
	8. Fuel ([Aircraft Systems - 05 - Fuel System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rya4YFDpsPs) from [[ERAU SpecialVFR]])
