- Logbook

Soon After Starting:

- Bag (backpack totally fine, flight bag if you'd like)
- SFO [[TAC]]

- [[Choosing a Ground School|Ground School]] Subscription (or other plan for ground school)
- Laminated checklists for your aircraft, such as [this one](https://www.mypilotstore.com/mypilotstore/sep/5067) or [this one](https://www.sportys.com/qref-cessna-checklist-pro-version.html)^[There can be a lot of value in making a custom checklist, potentially on [[ForeFlight]] or in a spreadsheet software. Just make sure it covers everything in the [[POH]] at a minimum.]
- (Optional) [Stool](https://a.co/d/6xdN8tf) for climbing to check fuel in high-wing plane, if desired

Before Starting XC:
- SFO Sectional
- Plotter
- E6B

- [[ForeFlight]] subscription, if you'd like

Before Night Flights:
- Headlamp with red light
- Backup flashlight (preferably red)^[Jack uses [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Powerful-Astronomy-Aviation-Observation-Black/dp/B06X3SY4LG/)]

After Checkride:

- A Sentry or similar portable [[ADS-B]] In
