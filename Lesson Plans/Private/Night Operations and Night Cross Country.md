## Night Operations and Night Cross Country

### Objective
Develop knowledge and skill pertaining to night flight.

### References
[[Private Pilot ACS]] Section XI; AFH Ch10 (night operations), PHAK Ch. 14 (airport lighting), Ch. 17 (night vision)

### Builds On
[[Airport Operations (Ground and Tower Communications, Ground Ops, Light Gun Signals)]], [[Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]], [[Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hour, flight 3 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Regulations pertaining to night flight
	1. Navigation lights required sunsetâ€”sunrise
	2. Logging night flight -- after civil twilight
	3. Night currency for carrying passengers -- 3 takeoffs and landings within 90 days, >1 hour after sunset
2. Aircraft lighting
	1. Anti-collision lights -- strobes and/or beacon
	2. Navigation lights
	3. Interior and panel lighting
3. Airport lighting
	1. Beacons, runway and taxi lighting, VASI, PAPI, REIL
	2. Pilot controlled lighting and how to operate
4. Navigation at night
	1. Pilotage and chart-reading techniques
	2. Approaches at night -- black hole illusion
	3. Importance of VASI or PAPI lights
5. Pilot considerations
	1. Physiology of night flight with respect to vision
	2. Personal lighting equipment
	3. Illusions affecting night approaches, e.g. "black hold approach"
6. Night flight experience -- 3 hours required:
	1. Dual cross-country of > 100nm
	2. 10 takeoffs and landings in pattern, full stop^[Notice both takeoff and landings must be at night. If you depart before/during civil twilight and land after civil twilight, that counts as 1 night landing, but not 1 night takeoff.]^[These 10 takeoffs and landings must also be around the pattern, not just the end of a flight.]
7. Common errors
	1. Navigational disorientation
	2. Loss of situational awareness, due to loss of visual horizon
	3. Getting low on final approach, due to black hole illusion
	4. Inadvertent flight into clouds is possible

### Completion StandardsClient demonstrates the knowledge and skills to safely fly and navigate at night.
