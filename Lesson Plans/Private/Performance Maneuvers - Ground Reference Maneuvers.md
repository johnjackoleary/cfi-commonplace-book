## Performance Maneuvers - Ground Reference Maneuvers

### Objective
Develop risk management and skills associated with ground referene maneuvers, including rectangular patterns, S-turns and turns around a point.

### References
[[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec V-B, [[AFH Ch7]]

### Builds On
[[Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.0 hours, Flight 1.0 hours
**CFI Equipment:** GPS/Sentry/ADS-B In

### Lesson Elements
1. Effect of wind during ground reference maneuvers
	1. Effects of wind on ground track and crab angle![[Wind Drift.jpeg]]
	2. Effect of bank angle and groundspeed on rate and radius of turn (relative to ground)![[Effect of Wind on Turn.jpeg]]
2. Flying all maneuvers
	1. Select location without excessive traffic, and with suitable emergency landing fields
	2. Select safe altitude and appropriate airspeed for maneuver
	3. Check for traffic in area before and between each maneuver
	4. Divide attention between airplane control, traffic, and ground references
3. Rectangular course
	1. Similarity to landing pattern
	2. Enter on 45 degree to downwind (as with traffic pattern)
	3. ![[Rectangular Course.jpeg]]
4. S-Turns
	1. Enter downwind, perpendicular to selected reference line, 600-1000'
	2. ![[S-Turns.jpeg]]
5. Turns around a point
	1. Enter on the downwind, at an appropriate spacing from the reference point
	2. ![[Turns Around a Point.jpeg]]
6. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to check for traffic or to locate emergency field
	2. Failure to divide attention aircraft control, instrument check, ground references, traffic and situational awareness
	3. Improper correction for wind drift
	4. Lack of rudder coordination
	5. Failure to maintain altitude or airspeed throughout the maneuver

### Completion StandardsClient must demonstrate the ability to choose an approriate location, select a safe entry speed, and perform the maneuvers to ACS standards. Tolerances: &plusmn;100 feet, &plusmn;10 knots, &plusmn;5 degrees bank, &plusmn;10 degrees heading on rollout.
