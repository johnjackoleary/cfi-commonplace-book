### Objective
To begin learning the fundamentals of straight and level (S&L) flight, turns, climbs, and descents; and controlling the airplane's attitude by visual reference to the horizon.

### References
- [[AFH Ch3]]
- [[PHAK Ch5]]

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 2 hours flight

### Lesson Elements

#### Straight and Level
1. Scanning for traffic!
2. Visual horizon to maintain direction and pitch attitude ([[NoseReferenceForSL.jpeg|image]])
3. Wingtip reference for level flight
4. Periodic cross-check of altimeter ([[90%-10% Outside vs Inside for Integrated Flight Instruction|aim for 90-10 split of time looking outside vs inside]])
5. Use of trim

![[Forces in Stabilized Flight]]

#### Level Turns
1. Check for traffic (high wing plane - lift wing slightly before banking)
2. [[Adverse Yaw]]
3. Rudder coordination, slips, skids, the ball ![[Indications of Slip and Skid.jpeg]]
4. Use of rudder to initiate and exit turn (cancel out adverse yaw)
5. Load factor, aft pressure to maintain altitude ![[Forces in Level Turn.jpeg]]

#### Climbs and Descents
![[Maneuver - Four Fundamentals]]

#### Climbing/Descending Turns
Establish climb or descent, then initiate turn.

#### Common errors
1. Forgetting to scan for traffic
2. Overcontrolling - use pressure, not movement, of controls
3. Chasing the instruments - looking at the instruments too often
4. Too firm grip on controls - relax, use fingertip pressure
5. Lack of rudder coordination

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate ability to use external visual references to maintain appropriate pitch and bank attitudes, with occasional cross-check of aircraft instruments. Learner must develop habit of visual scanning for traffic, and check for traffic before maneuvers. (ACS standards: ±10 knots, ±10 degrees, ±100 feet)

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.87]]: 
- Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions;
- Climbs and climbing turns;
- Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations;

### Required Homework
- [ ] Sign up for ground school if not yet completed (WVFC, Sporty's, etc)
- [ ] Complete 3rd class medical (See [[Finding an AME]])

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly four fundamentals
