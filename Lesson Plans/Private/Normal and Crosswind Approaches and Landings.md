### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with normal and crosswind approach and landing.

### References
[[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec IV-B, [[AFH Ch8]], [[POH]]

### Builds On
[[Maneuvering During Slow Flight]], [[Power-On and Power-Off Stalls]], [[Normal and Crosswind Takeoffs and Climbs]]

### Schedule
0.5 hours ground, multiple flights to practice as necessary

### Lesson Elements
1. Determining landing performance and limitations
2. Awareness of traffic, obstructions, hazards, wake turbulence
3. Importance of Stabilized Approach to landing
4. Downwind leg
	1. Awareness of traffic
	2. Power setting, configuration, airspeed for downwind
	3. Complete pre-landing checklist ([[POH]], [[FCCGUMPS]])
	4. Cross-wind correction if necessary
	5. Downwind abeam-the-numbers, start descent (traffic permitting)
5. Base leg
	1. When to turn base?
	2. Adjust configuration (flaps, speed, trim)
	3. Evaluate altitude, distance, wind. Correct as necessary
6. Final approach
	1. Coordinate turn to roll-out on runway centerline, establish cross-wind correction as needed
	2. Set flaps, trim for final approach speed
	3. Pitch for airspeed, power for altitude (use glidepath indicator if available). One hand on stick/yoke, other on throttle
	4. Maintain runway centerline
7. Roundout/Flare
	1. Judge speed and altitude to short final
	2. Use ailerons to maintain centerline, rudder to keep nose pointing down the runway, parallel to centerline (this is a "Side-Slip")
	3. Usually start flare about one wing-span above runway
8. Touchdown
	1. Smooth power reduction and pitch increase to level off just above runway at idle power
	2. Hold off with increasing back pressure to touch down in full-stall attitude
9. Rollout
	1. Maintain centerline with rudder
	2. Deflect ailerons into the wind, gradually increasing to full deflection at taxi speed
	3. Gentle braking
10. Taxi
	1. Exit runway, completely beyond hold-short lines
	2. Stop and complete after-landing checklist
	3. Contact ground frequency (unless staying with tower)
11. Common Errors
	1. Getting "behind the airplane", missing radio calls, missing traffic, etc.
	2. Forgetting checklists
	3. Non-stabilized approach
	4. Flaring too high or too low, bouncing, ballooning
	5. Poor directional control or drifting off centerline
	6. Excessive braking!

### Completion Standards
Client must become proficient at flying  stabilized approaches to landing, with smooth control application and safe touchdown and rollout in first third of runway length, with proper control application relative to crosswind.

### Required Homework
 None

### Recommended Homework
