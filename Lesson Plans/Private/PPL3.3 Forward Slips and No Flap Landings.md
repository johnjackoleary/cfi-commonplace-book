### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with forward slips to landing and no flap landings.

### Resources
- [[POH]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section IV.M
- [Slip Solution](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2009/january/flight-training-magazine/slip-solution) from [[AOPA]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL3.2 Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5, multiple flights to practice this maneuver frequently

### Lesson Elements

#### Forward Slips
1. Overview of forward slips
	1. Purpose - lose altitude quickly, without gaining airspeed.^[or lose airspeed without gaining altitude] Allows for steeper gliding descent for short-field or emergency landing
	2. [[Forward Slip.jpeg|Forward Slips]] vs [[Sideslip.jpeg|Sideslips]]?
		1. Sideslips are the usual technique for cross-wind landing, where heading parallel to runway. Rudder is used to keep parallel, bank to track centerline.
		2. Forward slips are steeper than side slips, with exaggerated bank (into the wind) and full opposite rudder. Rudder is fully deflected to create drag, and bank is used to track centerline.
	3. Adjust "steepness" of slip as necessary for intended landing spot
		> [!note] 
		> Aim to reacquire a normal glideslope if possible, not slip all the way to a landing
	1. Airspeed errors - what is effect of slip on indicated airspeed? Depends on number and location of static ports
	2. Check [[POH]]
		1. Are slips allowed with full flaps? 
		2. Will fuel ports uncover?^[More background on these in [Slip Solution](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2009/january/flight-training-magazine/slip-solution) from [[AOPA]]]
2. Flying the forward slip
	1. Reduce power to idle
	2. Lower wing into wind (if any), and apply full opposite rudder 
	4. Lower nose to maintain normal final approach indicated airspeed, depending on static port locations
	5. Adjust bank to maintain runway centerline
	6. Transition from forward slip to side slip (or no slip) before landing flare
	7. Beware of excessive sink rate due to forward slip. Keep enough airspeed to round out and flare.
3. Common errors
	1. Speed control during the slip
	2. Failure to maintain stable forward slip, allowing bank and heading to wander
	3. Failure to track the extended centerline
	4. Failure to go around if the approach becomes unstable

#### No Flap Landings
1. No flap landings may be needed if electrical system fails (in a C152/C172 or similar) or if flaps otherwise fail to deploy
2. Requires strict energy management to account for less drag available from flaps^[Similar energy management is needed in a [[CPL.3 Power Off 180 Accuracy Approach and Landing|power off 180]], and the tools of [[Flaps, Approach Geometry, Slip]] are similarly useful here]
	1. Forward slip may be used to increase drag as needed
	2. Geometry of the approach (e.g. extend downwind)
3. Landing attitude will be nose higher than normal to maintain same landing airspeed
4. Tips on flying a no-flap landing can be found in [this article](https://www.boldmethod.com/blog/learn-to-fly/manuevers/how-to-fly-a-no-flap-landing-pattern-through-touchdown/) from [[Bold Method]]
5. Approach speeds

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate smooth entry into a forward slip, with upwind wing down, maintaining runway centerline and safe airspeed, with smooth recovery from slip prior to round out. They must additionally demonstrate energy management while landing without the use of flaps.

> [!success]- Tolerances (Partial) from [[Private Pilot ACS|ACS]]
> **Forward slip**: Land within 400' of specified point; parallel, on centerline, nose up, no drift
