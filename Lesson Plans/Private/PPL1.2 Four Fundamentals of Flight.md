### Objective
Practice the fundamentals of straight and level (S&L) flight, turns, climbs, and descents; and controlling the airplane's attitude by visual reference to the horizon.

### Resources
N/A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 2 hours flight

### Lesson Elements
> [!tip] 
> Pitch + Power = Performance

> [!tip]
> Lift can be increased by increasing velocity, increasing angle of attack (up to [[Critical Angle of Attack]]), or adding flaps.

#### Straight and Level

**Aerodynamic Principles**
![[Forces in Stabilized Flight]]

**Discussion**
- What happens, during straight-and-level flight, if you add throttle? Why?
- What happens, during straight-and-level flight, if you extend flaps?  Why?

**In Practice**
1. Always be scanning for traffic!
2. Use the visual horizon to maintain direction and pitch attitude ([[NoseReferenceForSL.jpeg|image]])
3. Use wingtip reference to maintain level flight
4. Periodically cross-check the altimeter and heading indicator ([[90%-10% Outside vs Inside|aim for 90-10 split of time looking outside vs inside]])
5. Keep a light grip on the controls
6. Use trim to help



#### Level Turns
**Aerodynamic Principles**
1. The plane turns because the lift vector tilts, not because of the rudder
![[Forces in Level Turn.jpeg]]
2. To maintain altitude, additional lift is needed
	1. Apply back-pressure to the controls, increasing lift
	2. Sometimes add power, to overcome increased drag
3. [[Adverse Yaw]] requires using the rudder to maintain coordinated flight
4. [[Overbanking Tendency]] means you need to apply a bit of opposite aileron to keep the bank angle constant.
5. Back-pressure results in load factor > 1.0, and increased stall speed

**Discussion**
- At any given bank angle, what load factor is required to maintain level flight?
- What is the difference between 'slip' and 'skid'?  Which is more dangerous?

**In Practice**
1. Check for traffic (high wing plane - lift wing slightly before banking)
2. Roll into turn while adding rudder, and pulling back lightly on the controls
3. Neutralize ailerons once the turn is established; also, less rudder is required
4. Maintain coordination (counteract [[Adverse Yaw]]) using the rudder ([[Indications of Slip and Skid.jpeg]])
5. Relax, make adjustments, scan for traffic
6. Use opposite aileron to roll out, while relaxing back pressure, and staying coordinated

#### Climbs and Descents

**Notes**
- Different situations require climbs at Vx, Vy, or normal/cruise climb
- It's useful to memorize power settings for repeatable climbs/descents
- During climb, P-factor increases the need for right rudder

**In Practice**

![[Maneuver - Four Fundamentals]]

#### Climbing/Descending Turns
Establish climb or descent, then initiate turn.

#### Common errors
1. Forgetting to scan for traffic
2. Overcontrolling - use pressure, not movement, of controls
3. Chasing the instruments - looking at the instruments too often
4. Too firm grip on controls - relax, use fingertip pressure
5. Lack of rudder coordination

### Completion Standards
Learner must demonstrate ability to use external visual references to maintain appropriate pitch and bank attitudes, with occasional cross-check of aircraft instruments. Learner must develop habit of visual scanning for traffic, and check for traffic before maneuvers. (ACS standards: ±10 knots, ±10 degrees, ±100 feet)

### Required Logbook Phraseology
For [[FAR 61.87 Student Solo Reqs]]: 
- Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions;
- Climbs and climbing turns;
- Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations;

### Required Homework
None

### Recommended Homework
