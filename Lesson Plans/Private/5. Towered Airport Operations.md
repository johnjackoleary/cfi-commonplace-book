	2. Signs and Markings from [[PHAK Ch14]] and [[AIM 2-3]]
	3. Good review from [[AOPA]]: https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/aopa/runwaysafetyflashcard/index.php#/p/1
2. Radio communications #todo :: reorder
	1. Memorize frequencies for Palo Alto: [[ATIS]] 135.275, Ground 125.0, Tower 118.6, Emergency 121.5
	2. Format for all radio calls: WHO you're calling, WHO you are, WHERE you are (in 3D space), WHAT you want
	4. Required readbacks:
		1. Runway #, taxing instructions, hold short, line-up-and-wait, cleared-for-takeoff, cleared-to-land, etc.
		2. Sometimes specific request for readback in the ATIS
		3. If in doubt, readback full instructions.
	5. After tuning a frequency, PAUSE before talking to make sure you're not stepping on a conversation (counting to 4 seems to be the magic duration)
	6. Mentally rehearse what you will say before keying the mic.
	7. If in doubt, ask for clarification or request "say again"
	8. Anticipate the response and pay attention for any unusual elements
	9. Stuck microphones -- how to detect, how to respond

	1. [[Example Radio Calls]]
	2. #todo :: populate standard phraseology (wilco, roger, say again)
	3. #todo :: add note on double click of radio
	4. Listen to KPAO tower on handheld radio, or online at www.liveatc.net (KPAO tower or KSQL tower and ground, for example)

	2. Taxi instructions/clearances
5. [[Runway Incursions Overview, Risks, and Mitigations]]
6. [[Phonetic Alphabet]]
	1. Memorize them! Alpha through Zulu
	2. Special number pronunciations: "Tree" and "Niner"
	3. #todo :: move earlier
7. [[Light Gun Signals]]
	1. Example
		1. <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxoakUa8UqQ"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
		2. From *[Real Light Gun Signals | ATC Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxoakUa8UqQ)* by [FLY8MA.com Flight Training](https://www.youtube.com/@fly8ma.comflighttraining199)
	2. Debugging common radio issues (volume low, cable disconnect)
	3. Study and memorize the signals
	4. Put a copy onto your kneeboard (people forget in the stress of the moment!)
8. Common Errors
	1. Poor radio etiquette, stepping on others, getting tongue-tied
	2. Not reading back the required information
	3. Not scanning for traffic, or keeping traffic to follow in sight
