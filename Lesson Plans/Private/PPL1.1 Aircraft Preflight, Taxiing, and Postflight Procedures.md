### Objective
Develop skills associated with preparation for safe flight, including preflight inspection, engine starting, taxiing, before takeoff check, tie-down and securing aircraft.

### Resources
- [[POH]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections II.A, II.C, II.D, II.F, and XII.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
N/A

### Schedule
2.5 hours ground^[From Jack: I've found this lesson often takes a full 3 hours, without including engine start or runup. Perhaps this should be split into two lessons, or the taxi + runup portion added to PPL.2.], 0.5 hour flight (optional)

3. Preflight
	1. Walk-around inspection, use of checklists^[[[Wes Irish]] has a nice set of photos [here](https://sites.google.com/coyotehillconsulting.com/cfiwes/library/pre-flight-fails) for things he's noticed in preflights before]
	2. Airworthiness (who determines, who is responsible for)
