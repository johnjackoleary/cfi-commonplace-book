Develop initial knowledge of and sources for preflight briefings.

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
[[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]

### Schedule
3 hour ground

### Lesson Elements
> [!summary]- Expectations on Weather Briefs During Training
> Plan to get a weather brief before each flight.
> 
> Early in training, we'll discuss each lesson's go/no-go decision. Please message what you're seeing and if we could fly. That said, go/no-go will primarily be a [[CFI]] decision at this point, while you're developing weather [[ADM]].
> 
> Closer to solo, the go/no-go is more nuanced. Would you fly if you were going solo? What about flying with an instructor on board?
> 
> As we start cross-country, more of the PIC responsibility moves to you for go/no-go. I'll push back if it's a good day to practice something in particular, but increasingly the decision to fly is yours.
> 
> Nearing checkride, the go/no-go decision is completely yours. I'll make suggestions if there's a specific reason for learning, but generally, as long as it's safe and legal, we'll fly if you decide to.^[These flights are sometimes the most eye-opening, as going when there's an [[AIRMET]] Tango at altitude may be safe but miserable.]
