### Objective
Develop risk management and skills associated with ground reference maneuvers, including rectangular patterns, S-turns, and turns around a point.

### References
- [[AFH Ch7]]
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sec V-B

### Builds On
[[PPL.2 Four Fundamentals of Flight]]

### Schedule
1 hour ground, 2 hours flight

### CFI Equipment
GPS/Sentry/ADS-B In

### Lesson Elements
1. Effect of wind during ground reference maneuvers
	1. Effects of wind on ground track and crab angle![[Wind Drift.jpeg]]
	2. Effect of bank angle and groundspeed on rate and radius of turn (relative to ground)![[Effect of Wind on Turn.jpeg]]
2. Use [[Maneuvering Speed]]
	1. This speed changes with weight -- more weight raises maneuvering speed
3. Rate of turn and bank angle
4. Flying all maneuvers
	1. Select location without excessive traffic, and with suitable emergency landing fields
	2. Select safe altitude and appropriate airspeed for maneuver
	3. Check for traffic in area before and between each maneuver
	4. Divide attention between airplane control, traffic, and ground references
	5. [[Maneuver - Rectangular Course]]
	6. [[Maneuver - S-Turns]]
	7. [[Maneuver - Turns Around a Point]]
5. Common errors
	1. Forgetting to check for traffic or to locate emergency field
	2. Failure to divide attention aircraft control, instrument check, ground references, traffic and situational awareness
	3. Improper correction for wind drift
	4. Lack of rudder coordination
	5. Failure to maintain altitude or airspeed throughout the maneuver

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate the ability to choose an appropriate location, select a safe entry speed, and perform the maneuvers to ACS standards. Tolerances: ±100 feet, ±10 knots.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
