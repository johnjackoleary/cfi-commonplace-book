## Emergency Approaches and Landings

### Objective
Develop knowledge and skills associated with emergency approaches and landings, and ability to handle various systems and equipment failures.

### References
AFM/POH; [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section IX; [[AFH Ch17]] (Emergency Procedures)

### Builds On
[[Normal and Crosswind Approaches and Landings]], [[Forward Slips to Landing]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.0, Flight 1.0, frequent practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. Types of emergency landings: forced landing, precautionary landing, ditching
2. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate
3. ABCDE
	1. Airspeed - best glide
	2. Best place to land -- (hopefully) a preselected landing area
		1. If altitude allows: GPS NRST - what is closest airport?
	3. Checklist
		1.  Flow from memory based on type of emergency
		2. Cross-check POH checklist
	4. Declare - Squawk 7700, Mayday call with Approach or Center, nearby tower, or 121.5 (last resort)
	5. Execute emergency landing
4. Flying the approach
	1. Effects of headwinds/tailwinds
	2. Aircraft configuration, such as gear and flaps
	3. Debug the problem with flow pattern followed by checklist (if time permits)
	4. Spiral descent, and rectangular pattern if altitude permits
	5. Land INTO the wind!
	6. Keep altitude, and plan to use steep slip to control touchdown location
	7. Securing fuel and electrical systems before landing
	8. Unlatch doors before touchdown
5. Other emergencies (including all POH abnormal and emergency procedures)
	1. Engine failure after takeoff: Land straight ahead!
	2. Electrical malfunctions or complete failure
	3. Minimum fuel
	4. Engine fire
	5. Retractable gear malfunction
	6. [[VFR]] into [[IMC]]
	7. Icing
6. Common Errors
	1. Aviate first! Don't let distractions lead to loss of control.
	2. Route of flight with few or no landing options
	3. Lack of situational awareness. Be aware of positions and options.
	4. Failure to use checklist

### Completion Standards
Client should develop knowledge of emergency situations and procedures, and demonstrate ability to maneuver and land the airplane, while following checklist procedures including emergency communications.

### Required Homework
 
- [ ] Memorize engine out restart flow

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Chair fly all emergencies in POH
