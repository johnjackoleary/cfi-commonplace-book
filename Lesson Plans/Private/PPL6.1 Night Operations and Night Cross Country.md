### Objective
Develop knowledge and skill pertaining to night flight.

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Section XI.A

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts, National Airspace System, and Intro to FARs]]
- [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]

### Schedule
Ground 1 hour, flight 3 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Regulations pertaining to night flight
	1. Required equipment ([[FAR 91.205 Instrument and Equipment Requirements|§ 91.205]]) - [[APES]] or [[FLAPS]]
	2. Navigation lights required sunset-to-sunrise ([[FAR 91.209 Aircraft Lights|§ 91.209]])
	3. Logging night flight -- after civil twilight ([[Night - For Logging Time]])
	4. Night currency for carrying passengers -- 3 takeoffs and (fullstop) landings within 90 days, >1 hour after sunset ([[FAR 61.57 Recent Flight Experience|§ 61.57]])
2. Bay Area lcoal information
	1. PAO reverts to Class G, which means only right traffic on 31 when tower closed
	2. Many airports have unique noise abatement procedures at night
3. Aircraft lighting and night equipment
	2. Anti-collision lights -- strobes and/or beacon -- (required day or night, per [[FAR 91.209 Aircraft Lights|§ 91.209]])
	3. Navigation lights (aka position lights)
	4. Landing Lights
		1. > [!quote] From [[AFH Ch11]]
		> Pilots are encouraged to turn on their landing lights when operating within 10 miles of an airport and below 10,000 feet.
	5. Interior and panel lighting
	6. Fueling at night or before
4. [[Airport Lighting]]
5. Navigation at night
	7. Plan a route to maximize time within glide range of an airport
	8. Pilotage and chart-reading techniques
	9. Greater reliance on instruments is required
6. Pilot considerations
	10. Physiology of night flight with respect to vision
		1. [[Illusions Leading to Landing Errors]] are particularly prevalent at night
			1. [[False Horizon]]
			2. [[Autokinesis]]
			3. [[Black-Hole Approach]]
				1. Importance of [[VASI]] or [[PAPI]] lights
		2. [[Vision in Flight]] of even greater importance
	11. Personal lighting equipment
7. Night emergencies
8. The go/no-go decision
	12. Weather matters more than ever.  Clouds are invisible on a moon-less night
	13. A narrow temperature/dewpoint spread means fog could form soon
	14. How to detect inadvertent flight into [[IMC]]
9. Night flight experience -- 3 hours required:
	15. Dual cross-country of > 100nm
	16. 10 takeoffs and landings in pattern, full stop^[Notice both takeoff and landings must be at night. If you depart before/during civil twilight and land after civil twilight, that counts as 1 night landing, but not 1 night takeoff.]^[These 10 takeoffs and landings must also be around the pattern, not just the end of a flight.]
10. Common errors
	17. Navigational disorientation
	18. Loss of spatial awareness, due to loss of visual horizon^[[[Illusions Leading to Spatial Disorientation]]]
	19. Getting low on final approach, due to black hole illusion^[[[Illusions Leading to Landing Errors]]]
	20. Inadvertent flight into clouds is possible

### Completion Standards
Client demonstrates the knowledge and skills to fly and navigate at night safely.

### Required Logbook Phraseology
[[FAR 61.107 PPL Flight Reqs]]:
- (b)(1)(xi) Night operations

> [!note] 
> Specific night flight requirements from [[FAR 61.109 PPL Experience Reqs]]:
> - 3 hours of night flight training in a single-engine airplane that includes—
> 	- (i) One cross-country flight of over 100 nautical miles total distance; and
> 	- (ii) 10 takeoffs and 10 landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport.

### Required Homework
 
- [ ] Plan >101nm night cross-country flight

### Recommended Homework
