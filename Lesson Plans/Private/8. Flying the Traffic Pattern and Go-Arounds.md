### Objective
Develop knowledge of towered airport traffic patterns, skill and judgement in approaching and departing various types of patterns, and good procedures while flying the pattern. Additionally develop knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with go-around or rejected landing, with emphasis on landing conditions that may require a go-around.

### Lesson Elements
#### Traffic Pattern
1. General traffic patterns
	1. [[Left Traffic Pattern.jpeg]]
	2. Five named legs
	3. Distances around traffic pattern
		1. Downwind is 1/2 to 1 mile out
		2. Turn base at approximately 45° to the approach end of runway
	4. Typically left traffic (meaning making left turns)
	5. Emphasis on the word 'pattern'
2. Finding entry procedures and pattern information
	1. Sectionals
	2. Chart Supplements (A/FD)
	3. ForeFlight
	4. Airport website for noise abatement or other procedures
3. Towered Airport (Palo Alto traffic procedures as example)
	1. Pattern altitude: 800' on east side, 1000' on west side
	2. Entering Pattern
		1. Visual Reporting points for calling in to KPAO, SLAC, Woodside VOR, Windy Hill, Leslie Salt, Coyote Hills, Sunol Pass, etc....
		2. Approaching from west: maintain 1500' until crossing 101 freeway
		3. Typically enter on 45° downwind, unless told otherwise by tower
	3. Leaving the Pattern
		1. Common departures: Left and Right Dumbarton, 270 overhead
	4. Flying the pattern 
		1. Standard Right Traffic for runway 31, turn right 10 degrees after departure for noise abatement
		2. Memorize power settings/airspeeds, use wind correction angle like [[Maneuver - Rectangular Course|rectangular course]]
4. Power, Airspeed, and Config for `=this.datasheet.model`
	1. Downwind Leg: `=this.datasheet.pattern-downwind-rpm` RPM, `=this.datasheet.pattern-downwind-kias`kts
	2. Abeam Threshold: `=this.datasheet.pattern-abeam-rpm` RPM, `=this.datasheet.pattern-abeam-kias`kts, flaps `=this.datasheet.pattern-abeam-flaps`
	3. Base Leg: `=this.datasheet.pattern-base-rpm` RPM, `=this.datasheet.pattern-base-kias`kts, flaps `=this.datasheet.pattern-base-flaps`
	4. Final Leg: `=this.datasheet.pattern-final-rpm` RPM, `=this.datasheet.pattern-final-kias`kts, flaps `=this.datasheet.pattern-final-flaps`
6. Common Errors
	1. Lack of planning ahead, staying ahead of the airplane
	2. Lack of situation awareness or awareness of other traffic
	3. Improper radio usage, forgetting radio calls at non-towered airports


#### Go-Arounds
1. Situations requiring a go-around
	1. Be prepared constantly for go-around. Every landing is a potential go-around! Go-around sooner, rather than later. Don't let things get out of hand!
	2. Too high to land in first third of runway
	3. Traffic on runway, or instruction from tower to go-around
	4. Unstable final approach
	5. Possibility of wake turbulence
	6. Wind shear or gusty crosswind
	7. Bounced landing, or ballooning during flare
2. Go-around procedure for `=this.datasheet.model`
	1. [[Go-Around Procedure.jpeg]]
	2. Stop the Descent (Cram)
		1. Full power (throttle and prop), smooth but rapid, carb heat off
		2. Set flaps to `=this.datasheet.flaps-for-stall-recover`
		3. Accelerate to Vx
	3. Climb
		1. Pitch to Vx or Vy climb attitude by visual reference to horizon
		2. Trim for Vx or Vy
		3. Move off centerline, if another aircraft on runway
	4. Cool: `= this.datasheet.cool-procedure`
	5. Configure
		1. Verify positive rate of climb, set incrementally set flaps for normal climb
	6. Call
		1. Report go-around to tower ([[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate|Aviate, Navigate, then Communicate]])
	7. Use take-off check-list
4. Common Errors
	1. Initiating go-around too late
	2. Too slow power application, leaving carb heat on
	3. Improper pitch attitude, causing touch down or porpoise
	4. Lack of rudder usage to correct for P-factor and torque
	5. Drifting from runway centerline (unless offsetting for conflicting traffic)
	6. Forgetting checklist items (flaps, carb heat, cowl flaps)

### Completion Standards
Client must demonstrate proficiency at planning and flying pattern approaches and departures at towered airports, complying with AIM recommended procedures, maintaining awareness of and proper spacing from other aircraft. Maintain traffic pattern altitude ±100 feet, and airspeed ±10 knots (or mph). For go-around, apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for [[Vx]] or [[Vx]] as appropriate +10/-5 knots.

### Required Homework

- [ ] Memorize power settings/airspeeds for pattern
