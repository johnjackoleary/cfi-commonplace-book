### Objective
Develop ability to obtain, process and understand pre-flight weather briefings, and use weather data. 

### Resources
- [[Private Pilot ACS]] Sections I.C, I.D
- [[Aviation Weather Handbook]]
- [[AC 91-92]]

> [!tip] Pre-Lesson Reading/Homework here: [[~ PPL Pre-Lesson Reading]]

### Builds On
- [[SOLO.3 Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5 hour, practice on multiple flights

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[XC.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]].

### Lesson Elements
> [!info]- Structure of XC Lessons...
> Lessons [[XC.2 Advanced Airport Operations|XC.2]], [[XC.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment|XC.3]], [[XC.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance|XC.4]], [[XC.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning|XC.5]], & [[XC.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning|XC.6]] can be thought of as building out each part of a flight plan.

1. Weather and Weather Briefings
	1. Weather theory -- see [[Aviation Weather Handbook]] for best resources
		1. Air Masses and Fronts
			1. [[Winds Around Pressure Systems.jpeg]]
			2. [[Isobars Reveal Pressure Gradient.jpeg]]
			3. Warm, Cold, Stationary, and Occluded Fronts
		2. Atmospheric Stability ([[Temp Lapse Rates Effect on Stability.jpeg]]^[The 3째C per 1000ft is the dry adiabatic lapse rate and 0.5째C is the dew point lapse rate, used in this image. See Chap 12/13 of [[Aviation Weather Handbook]] for more info.])
			1. "As air ascends through the atmosphere, the average rate of temperature change is 2 째C (3.5 째F) per 1,000 feet." - [[PHAK Ch12]]
			2. [[Convective Turbulence Avoidance.jpeg]]
		3. Recognizing [[thunderstorm]]s, [[wind shear]], [[Ice Hazards and Aircraft Icing|ice]], and other critical weather situations
	2. Weather briefings in depth
		1. Structure of weather briefings
		2. Adverse conditions: [[TFR]]s, [[NOTAM]]s, [[SIGMET]]s, [[AIRMET]]s, etc.
		3. Current weather
		4. Forecasts: Area, [[TAF]]s, [[Winds Aloft]], [[MOS]]
	3. Types of [[weather brief|weather briefings]] from Flight Service
		1. Outlook
		2. Standard
		3. Abbreviated
2. Other topics related to cross-country planning and flying:
	1. [[Human Factors]]
	2. How to share expenses? [[AC 61-142]] and [[FAR 61.113 Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations]]
	3. Flight Services Enroute
	4. [[VFR]] flight plans for search and rescue
		1. When to use them
		2. How to file
		3. How to activate and close
	5. Estimating visibility in flight^[Some suggestions from [[AOPA]] in [this article](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2008/april/flight-training-magazine/basic-vfr)]
