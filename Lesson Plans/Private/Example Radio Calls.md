## Example Radio Calls for Palo Alto operations
1. Don’t forget to listen to ATIS prior to first call (before taxi, or before calling tower upon return to airport).
2. Ready to taxi for runway 31 for pattern work:
	1. “Palo Alto Ground, Citabria Three-Seven-Four-Delta-Mike, parked West Valley, taxi Three-One with November, closed traffic”.
	2.  Reply will be similar to: “Citabria Three-Seven-Four-Delta-Mike, taxi Three-One via hangar side, Juliet, Papa, Yankee, Yankee One, Zulu, Advise Ground when runup complete.”
	3. Readback: “Four Delta Mike, runway Three One via Juliet, Papa, Yankee, Yankee One, Zulu”.
3. Ready to taxi for runway 13
	1. “Palo Alto Ground, Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, parked West Valley, taxi One Three with November, Left 270 Overhead departure”.
	2. Reply will be similar to: “Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, taxi runway One-Three via Hangar Side, Juliet, Yankee, Yankee Three, Zulu, hold short Yankee Three”.
	3. Readback: “Six Juliet Romeo, runway runway One-Three via Hangar Side, Juliet, Yankee, Yankee Three, Zulu, hold short Yankee Three”.
4. After runup, ready for takeoff:
	1. “Ground, Citabria Six-Juliet-Romeo, Runup Complete”
	2. Ground replies: “Citabria Six Juliet Romeo, hold short Yankee One, contact Tower”. Readback: “Six Juliet Romeo, hold short Yankee One, contact Tower”
	4. Contact tower for takeoff clearance: “Palo Alto Tower, Citabria Five-NinerSix-Juliet-Romeo, Ready for takeoff”. Expect to hear: “Citabria Five-NinerSix-Juliet-Romeo, Palo Alto Tower, hold short Runway Three-One”. Readback: “Tower, Citabria Six-Juliet-Romeo, holding short Three-One”. And then maybe something like: “Citabria Six-Juliet-Romeo, cleared for takeoff runway Three One, left Dumbarton Departure, follow Cessna on upwind”. Readback: “Six-Juliet-Romeo, cleared for takeoff Three-One, left Dumbarton Departure, following Cessna”.
5. Initial call when returning for landing:
	1. “Palo Alto Tower, Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, [[SLAC]], inbound with Bravo”
	2. Expect reply: “Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, Palo Alto Tower, make left traffic runway Three One, traffic departing Palo Alto to the south climbing through 2000’”
	3. Readback: “Six Juliet Romeo, left traffic Three One, looking for traffic”
6. Arriving on downwind:
	1. Expect to hear something like: “Citabria Six Juliet Romeo, cleared to land runway Three-One, #2, follow Cessna on 1-mile final”.
	2. Readback: “Six Juliet Romeo, cleared to land Three-One, #2, traffic in sight” (or “looking for traffic” if you don’t yet have your traffic in sight).
7. While flying the traffic pattern, if you don’t know your landing sequence:
	1. “Tower, Citabria Six-Juliet-Romeo, what’s our sequence?”
	2. Expect reply such as: “Six-Juliet-Romeo, extend downwind, following Cirrus on Four mile final over Moffat, I’ll call your base” (In this case, stay on downwind until Tower asks you to turn base).
8. After landing, taxi clearance back to parking, after switching to ground frequency (or sometimes on tower, if only one controller is working):
	1. “Palo Alto Ground, Citabria Five-Niner-Six-Juliet-Romeo, on Zulu, taxi West Valley parking.”
	2. Expect reply: “Six Juliet Romeo, PA Ground, taxi to parking via Zulu, Yankee2, suggest Juliet, hangar side”.
	3. Readback: “Six Juliet Romeo, taxi Zulu, Yankee2, Juliet, hangar side”.
