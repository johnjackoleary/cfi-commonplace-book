### Objective
Confirm learner's flight proficiency is comparable to when they passed their checkride, and work to close any gaps.

### Resources
- Based on [[AC 61-98]] Appendix J
- [[IFR Regulatory Review Assignment]]

### Builds On
[[IPC.0 Preparation]]

### Schedule
Schedule set as part of [[IPC.0 Preparation]]

> [!note] 
> Can be completed at the same time as with [[IPC.1 Ground Review]], or done as a separate lesson so the IPC isn't as long.

### Equipment
Hood, foggles, or other view-limiting device

### Lesson Elements
> [!note]
> Flight will be structured like a IFR XC outbound, then focused on airwork for the return trip.
