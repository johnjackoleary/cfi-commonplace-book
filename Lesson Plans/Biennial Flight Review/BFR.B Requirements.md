From [[FAR 61.56 Flight Review]]:

> [!quote] Ground & Flight Training Approach^[[[FAR 61.56 Flight Review]] lists other methods of completing a BFR, such as "satisfactorily accomplished one or more phases of an FAA-sponsored pilot proficiency award program" or pass a "pilot proficiency check or practical test". Please read this regulation for additional details.]
> A minimum of 1 hour of flight training and 1 hour of ground training. The review must include:
> - [ ] A review of the current general operating and flight rules of [part 91 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-91)
> - [ ] A review of those maneuvers and procedures that, at the discretion of the person giving the review, are necessary for the pilot to demonstrate the safe exercise of the privileges of the pilot certificate.

> The goal is to get the learner back to roughly the same proficiency they were at their checkride. A [[BFR]] is not pass/fail -- it is about training as needed to regain proficiency.
