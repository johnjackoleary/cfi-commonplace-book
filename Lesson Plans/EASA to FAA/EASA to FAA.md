### Summary
[[FAR 61.75 PPL Cert from Foreign License|FAR 61.75]] allows individuals with certain foreign pilot licenses to be issued a U.S. private pilot certificate with the appropriate ratings.

This page is meant to capture notes on this process, especially highlighting differences in experience and training requirements that may be good to discuss with a [[CFI]].

### General Process
A [[TSA Flight Training Security Program (FTSP)]] 

### Training Differences
 There are a few notable differences in expected maneuveres and experience for a [[EASA]] [[PPL]] [[SEP]] compared to an [[FAA]] [[PPL]] [[ASEL]].

Will night flight be allowed? Depends on if there's an actual restriction: https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2014/Grossman-Delvag_Luftfahrtversicherungs_2014_Legal_Interpretation.pdf and https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2012/Krausz-Beaumont&Son_2012_Legal_Interpretation.pdf and https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/w5d9tn/easa_ppl_to_faa_conversion_without_night_rating/

Likely knowledge differences (this list currently from ChatGPT to get started)
1. **Night Flying Requirements**: The FAA PPL requires specific training and experience for night flying, including a minimum of 3 hours of night flight training, including one cross-country flight of over 100 nautical miles total distance and 10 takeoffs and landings to a full stop at an airport.
2. **Cross-Country Flight Planning**: While both FAA and EASA training include cross-country flight planning, there may be differences in emphasis or specific requirements, such as use of FAA charts and navigation aids versus European charts and navigation aids.
3. **Flight Training in Controlled Airspace**: The FAA PPL training includes instruction and experience in operating within controlled airspace, including communication with air traffic control and understanding of airspace classifications and procedures. While EASA SEP training covers similar topics, the specific procedures and regulations may differ.
4. **Special Use Airspace**: FAA training may include instruction on operating in special use airspace, such as military operations areas ([[MOA]]s) or temporary flight restrictions ([[TFR]]s), which may not be as prevalent or relevant in European airspace.
5. **Flight Following Procedures**: The FAA emphasizes procedures for requesting and utilizing flight following services from air traffic control, which may not have direct equivalents in EASA training.
6. **Mountain Flying**: Depending on the location of training, FAA PPL training may include instruction on mountain flying techniques and considerations, which may not be as applicable in European training environments.
