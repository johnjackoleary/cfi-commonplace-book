### Lesson Elements
1. [[LRU]]s - [[Basic G1000 System.jpeg]]
	1. [[GDU]] 1040/1044B - 10.4-inch LCD display with 1024 x 768 resolution
		2. left - [[PFD]], right - [[MFD]]
		3. Paired to each other and to GIA 63W
	2. [[GIA]] 63W - main communication hub, linking all LRUs with the PFD
		1. GPS receiver, VHF COM/NAV/GS receivers, a flight director (FD) and system integration microprocessors
		2. GIAs are not paired together
	3. GDC 74A - Air Data Computer
		1. data from the pitot/static system as well as the OAT probe
		2. pressure altitude, airspeed, vertical speed and OAT
	4. GEA 71 Engine/Airframe Unit
	5. GRS 77 Attitude and Heading Reference System ([[AHRS]])
		1. aircraft attitude and heading information
		2. to both the GDU 1040/1044B and the GIA 63W.
	6. GMU 44 Magnetometer
		1. Measures local magnetic field
		2. receives power directly from the GRS 77 and communicates with the GRS 77
	7. GMA 1347 Audio System with Integrated Marker Beacon Receiver
		1. integrates NAV/COM digital audio, intercom system and marker beacon controls
		2. also controls manual display [[reversionary mode]]
2. Interface ![[G1000 Interface Controls.jpeg]]
3. Flight Instruments
4. Engine System Indication
	1. Good practice to check for EGT rise during run-up mag check
5. Flight Management / Navigation
6. Hazard Avoidance
	1. Weather
	2. Terrain
	3. Traffic
7. Autopilot
8. Failures and Annunciations

### Completion Standards
Learner can use the G1000 for a cross country trip (using VOR and GPS) without needing a reference guide, and for assistance with lost procedures and diversions. Learner can identify and address failure modes.
