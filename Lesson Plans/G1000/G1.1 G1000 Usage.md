### Lesson Elements
1. [[LRU]]s - [[Basic G1000 System.jpeg]]
	1. [[GDU]] 1040/1044B - 10.4-inch LCD display with 1024 x 768 resolution
		2. left - [[PFD]], right - [[MFD]]
		3. Paired to each other and to GIA 63W
	2. [[GIA]] 63W - main communication hub, linking all LRUs with the PFD
		1. GPS receiver, VHF COM/NAV/GS receivers, a flight director (FD) and system integration microprocessors
		2. GIAs are not paired together
	3. GDC 74A - Air Data Computer
		1. data from the pitot/static system as well as the OAT probe
		2. pressure altitude, airspeed, vertical speed and OAT
	4. GEA 71 Engine/Airframe Unit
	5. GRS 77 Attitude and Heading Reference System ([[AHRS]])
		1. aircraft attitude and heading information
		2. to both the GDU 1040/1044B and the GIA 63W.
	6. GMU 44 Magnetometer
		1. Measures local magnetic field
		2. receives power directly from the GRS 77 and communicates with the GRS 77
	7. GMA 1347 Audio System with Integrated Marker Beacon Receiver
		1. integrates NAV/COM digital audio, intercom system and marker beacon controls
		2. also controls manual display [[reversionary mode]]
2. Interface![[G1000 Interface Controls]]
	1.  NAV VOL/ID Knob – Controls the NAV audio level. Press to toggle the Morse code identifier ON and OFF. Volume level is shown in the field as a percentage.
	2. NAV Frequency Transfer Key – Transfers the standby and active NAV frequencies.
	3. Dual NAV Knob – Tunes the MHz (large knob) and kHz (small knob) standby frequencies for the NAV receiver. Press to toggle the tuning cursor (light blue box) between the NAV1 and NAV2 fields.
	4. Heading Knob – Turn to manually select a heading on the HSI. When pressed, it synchronizes the heading bug with the compass lubber line. Selected Heading provides the heading reference to the Flight Director while operating in Heading Select mode.
	5. Joystick – Changes the map range (distance top to bottom of map display) when rotated. Activates the map pointer when pressed.
	6. CRS/BARO Knob – The large knob sets the altimeter barometric pressure and the small knob adjusts the course. The course is only adjustable when the HSI is in VOR1, VOR2, or OBS/SUSP mode. Pressing this knob centers the CDI on the currently selected VOR. Selected Course provides course reference to the Flight Director when operating in Navigation and Approach modes.
	7. Dual COM Knob – Tunes the MHz (large knob) and kHz (small knob) standby frequencies for the COM transceiver. Pressing this knob toggles the tuning cursor (light blue box) between the COM1 and COM2 fields.
	8. COM Frequency Transfer Key – Transfers the standby and active COM frequencies. Pressing and holding this key for two seconds automatically tunes the emergency frequency (121.5 MHz) in the active frequency field.
	9. COM VOL/SQ Knob – Controls COM audio level. Audio volume level is shown in the field as a percentage. Pressing this knob turns the COM automatic squelch ON and OFF.
	10. Direct-to Key – Allows the user to enter a destination waypoint and establish a direct course to the selected destination (specified by the identifier, chosen from the active route, or taken from the map pointer position).
	11. FPL Key – Displays the active Flight Plan Page for creating and editing the active flight plan, or for accessing stored flight plans.
	12. CLR Key (DFLT MAP) – Erases information, cancels an entry, or removes page menus. To display the Navigation Map Page immediately, press and hold CLR (MFD only).
	13. Dual FMS Knob – Press to turn the selection cursor ON/OFF. Data.
		1. Entry: With the cursor ON, turn to enter data in the highlighted field (large knob moves cursor location; small knob selects character for highlighted cursor location). When the cursor is turned ON while viewing the Active Flight Plan Page, the cursor is placed on the line below the Data Insertion Pointer see Figure 1-4. The pointer indicates data entered at the cursor will be inserted above the line selected.
		2. Scrolling: When a list of information is too long for the window/box, a scroll bar appears, indicating more items to view. With cursor ON, turn large knob to scroll through the list. 
		3. Page Selection: Turn knob on MFD to select the page to view (large knob selects a page group; small knob selects a specific page from the group)
	14. MENU Key – Displays a context-sensitive list of options. This list allows the user to access additional features, or to make setting changes that relate to certain pages.
	15. PROC Key – Selects approaches, departures and arrivals from the flight plan. If a flight plan is used, available procedures for the departure and/or arrival airport are automatically suggested. If a flight plan is not used, the desired airport and the desired procedure may be selected. This key selects IFR departure procedures (DPs), arrival procedures (STARs) and approaches (IAPs) from the database and loads them into the active flight plan.
	16. ENT Key – Accepts a menu selection or data entry. This key is used to approve an operation or complete data entry. It is also used to confirm selections and information entries.
	17. Dual ALT Knob – Sets the selected altitude in the box located above the Altimeter. The large knob selects the thousands (500m for metric), while the small knob selects the hundreds (50m for metric). Altitude Select is used by the Automatic Flight Control System in certain modes, in addition to the standard G1000 Altitude Alerter function.
3. Pages and Page Groups
