	1. Remove power on downwind leg, abeam numbers.
	2. Configure plane for V<sub>G</sub>
	3. As necessary, correlate crosswind with direction of forward slip and transition to side slip for landing.
	4. ‡ Touch down at a proper pitch attitude, **within 200 feet beyond or on the specified point with no side drift and with the airplane’s longitudinal axis aligned** with and over the runway centerline or landing path, as applicable.
8. Go-Around/Rejected Landing (IV.N)
	1. Timely go-around decision with immediate application of power.
	2. Transition to V<sub>Y</sub> (or maybe V<sub>X</sub>).
	3. Configure for climb after positive rate of climb.
	4. Move to side of runway to avoid traffic on runway.
	5. Remainder same as normal takeoff.

Summary: Ground Reference Maneuvers 
Preferred Conditions: Winds Aloft

ACS Tasks:
1. For All
	1. Clear the area.
	2. Select an altitude that will allow the maneuver to be performed no lower than 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL).
2. Steep Spiral (V.B)
	1. Start with enough altitude to complete three 360° turns.
	2. Establish and maintain a steep spiral by closing throttle and hitting V<sub>G</sub>
	3. ‡ Apply wind-drift correction to **track a constant radius circle around selected reference point with bank not to exceed 60°** at steepest point in turn.
	4. ‡ Maintain the specified **airspeed, ±10 knots and roll out toward an object or specified heading, ±10°, and complete the maneuver no lower than 1,500’ AGL**.
3. Eights on Pylons
	1. State pivotal altitude. Pivotal altitude may be approximated by squaring groundspeed (knots), then dividing by 11.3.
	2. Pick two pylons that will allow straight-and-level flight between the pylons, preferably perpendicular to wind, and with good landing spot nearby.
	3. Enter crosswind so first turn is into the wind.
	4. Establish the correct bank angle for the conditions, **not to exceed 40°**.
	5. Keep line of sight on pylon while dividing attention outside and inside.
	6. Keep coordinated flight.
