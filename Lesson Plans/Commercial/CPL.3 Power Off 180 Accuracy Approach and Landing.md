### Objective
The 180° power-off approach is executed by gliding with idle power from a given point on a downwind leg to a preselected landing spot.

> [!note]
> This is one of the most challenging maneuvers in the Commercial ACS, since you must land on or beyond a point on the runway, and within 200 feet of it!

### Lesson Elements

1. Tips
	1. Practicing judging your glidepath is key -- practice seeing your glide from progressively further back in the pattern
	2. Pick an “aiming point” on the runway about 200’ short of your touchdown target
	3. Don’t come in low, because you can’t use power to rescue it!
	4. Plan to come in slightly high, and use low power and/or slipping to glide towards your aiming point.^[Check out [[Flaps, Approach Geometry, Slip]]]
	5. Judge the roundout and flare to carry you into the 200’ touchdown zone.
	6. Technically, no go-around is allowed, unless it is for traffic or other factors beyond the pilot’s control.
2. Common Errors:
	1. Poor airspeed control
	2. Aiming at your touchdown spot instead of the aiming spot 200’ closer
	3. Not compensating for winds
	4. Attempting to "stretch" the glide

### Completion Standards
Learner is able to consistently land in the 200' zone, regardless of wind conditions.
