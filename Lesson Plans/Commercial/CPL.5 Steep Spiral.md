### Objective
Understand purpose and procedures of a steep spiral. Develop skills required to execute a steep spiral to ACS standards.

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 2 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Purpose
	1. A steep spiral allows for rapidly dissipating altitude while remaining over a selected spot
	2. May be useful during an emergency landing. 
2. Technique ![[Steep Spiral.jpeg]]
	1. A steep spiral is a gliding turn wherein the pilot maintains a constant radius around a surface-based reference point—similar to the turns around a point maneuver, but in this case the airplane is rapidly descending. 
	2. The maneuver consists of the completion of at least three 360° turns and should begin at sufficient altitude such that the maneuver concludes no lower than 1,500 feet [[AGL]]. 
> [!note]
> While there are similarities between a steep spiral and an emergency descent, the reasons for using the two maneuvers may differ, and the airspeed and configuration are usually different.
5. Flying the Maneuver
	1. Preparation
		1. Start at an altitude that allows at least 3 complete turns, finishing above 1,500' AGL
		2. Clear the area
		3. Select a reference point out the window almost straight below you
		4. Note the wind direction and your initial heading and altitude
	2. Initiation
		1. Reduce power to idle
		2. Establish initial bank angle (<60°) and airspeed (best glide speed or somewhat faster)
	3. Make 3 revolutions
		1. Increase/decrease bank angle as needed to keep the reference point at the same spot relative to you (higher bank angle downwind, less on upwind)
		2. Note loss of altitude each time you return to original heading
		3. In a carbureted airplane, carb icing is a danger-- test the engine periodically by adding a bit of power
		4. After 3 revolutions, roll to wings level, and return to cruise speed
6. Common Errors
	1. Failing to clear the area
	2. Starting too low to finish above 1500' AGL
	3. Choosing a point too far away; needs to be almost right below the plane
	4. Letting airspeed increase or decrease over time
	5. Failing to divide attention between airplane control, traffic avoidance, and the ground track

### Completion Standards
Pilot is able to maintain a constant radius around a reference point at the specified airspeed, ±10 knots, roll out toward an object or specified heading, ±10°, and complete the maneuver no lower than 1,500’ [[AGL]], without exceeding 60° of bank.
