### Objective
Understand purpose and procedures of a steep spiral. Develop skills required to execute a steep spiral to ACS standards.

### References
- [[AFH Ch10]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.10 Ground Reference Maneuvers]]
- [[PPL.15 Emergency Landings]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 2 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Purpose
	1. A steep spiral allows for rapidly dissipating altitude while remaining over a selected spot
	2. May be useful during an emergency landing. 
2. Technique ![[Steep Spiral.jpeg]]
	1. A steep spiral is a gliding turn wherein the pilot maintains a constant radius around a surface-based reference point—similar to the turns around a point maneuver, but in this case the airplane is rapidly descending. 
	2. The maneuver consists of the completion of at least three 360° turns and should begin at sufficient altitude such that the maneuver concludes no lower than 1,500 feet [[AGL]]. 
> [!note]
> While there are similarities between a steep spiral and an emergency descent, the reasons for using the two maneuvers may differ, and the airspeed and configuration are usually different.
5. Flying the Maneuver
	1. Clear Area, select reference point, determine wind direction
	2. Select altitude to allow at least 3 complete turns finishing above 1,500'
	3. Establish best glide speed or somewhat faster, <= 60° bank maximum

### Completion Standards
Learner is able to maintain constant radius around reference point at the specified airspeed, ±10 knots, and roll out toward an object or specified heading, ±10°, and complete the maneuver no lower than 1,500’ [[AGL]].
