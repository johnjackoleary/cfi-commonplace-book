### Objective
Discussion of differences between commercial and private pilot licenses, and set expectations for the training process.

### References
- [[Risk Management Handbook]]
- [[Part 830]]
- [[AC 120-12]]
- [[AC 61-142]]
- [[AC 91-67]]

### Resources
- [[Pyramid of Airworthiness]]
- [[UND]] [playlist of commercial and instrument maneuvers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1B5890E8D2DB569C)

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]
- [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5-3 hours, depending on memory of concepts from [[PPL]]

### Lesson Elements
1. Overview of [[~ CPL Lesson Plan Outline|Commercial Syllabus]]
2. Overview on Commercial License
	1. *"A commercial pilot may be compensated for flying"* - [[PHAK Ch1]]
	2. **Operations/Systems**: Thorough understanding of systems and higher standards for operations
	3. **Regulations**: Introduction of commercial operations requires a wider and deeper understanding of the [[FAR]]s
	4. **Maneuvers**: [[PPL]] maneuvers are mostly 1 dimensional, [[CPL]] requires maneuvering simultaneously in 2 dimensions
3. [[Commercial ACS]] I. Preflight Preparation
	1. I.A. Pilot Qualifications
		1. Builds on the foundation in [[Complete VFR Preflight Checklist#Pilot]] section
		2. Understand the nuances of [[Commercial Pilot Privileges and Limitations]]
		3. [[Medical Certificate Requirements]]
	2. I.B. Airworthiness Requirements
		1. Review [[Complete VFR Preflight Checklist#Aircraft]] section
		2. Obtaining a special flight permit^[For the San Jose [[FSDO]], it sounds like this takes about a week]
		3. Pilot-performed preventative maintenance (see [[FAR 43.3 Persons Authorized to Maintain|ยง 43.3]](g) and [ยง 43 Appendix A](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-43/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%2043))
	3. I.C. Weather Information
		1. Review [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]] and [[IR.14 IFR Weather and Weather Services]]
		2. Gain deeper understanding from [[PHAK Ch12]] and [[PHAK Ch13]]
	4. I.D. Cross-Country Flight Planning
		1. Review:
			1. [[PPL4.1 Intro to Cross Country Flying]]
			2. [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations]]
			3. [[PPL4.3 Flight Planning, Navigation Systems, and Other XC Equipment]]
			4. [[PPL4.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance]]
			5. [[PPL4.5 Advanced Weather Briefs and Preflight Planning]]
			6. [[PPL4.6 Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]]
			7. [[PPL4.7 Making the Go-No-Go Decision]]
	5. I.E. National Airspace System
		1. Review [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts, National Airspace System, and Intro to FARs]]
	6. I.F. Performance and Limitation
		1. Review [[PPL4.4 Aircraft Performance and Weight+Balance]]
	7. I.G. Operation of Systems
		1. Review [[PPL2.6 Aircraft Systems]]
	8. I.H. Human Factors
		1. Review [[Human Factors]]
4. Preflight Procedures
	1. Relevant to [[Commercial ACS]] II.A, II.B, II.C, II.D, and II.F
	2. Q&A to feel out weak areas in understanding of [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]] and [[Complete VFR Preflight Checklist]]
	3. Additional emphasis on
		1. Approved [[MEL]] and the [[4 Types of MEL's]], related to [[FAR 91.213 Inop Equip]]
		2. [[Risk Management]] and related mnemonics ([[PAVE]], [[IMSAFE]], [[5Ps]], etc)
		3. [[5 Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes]]
5. Postflight procedures
6. [[ADM]] and [[Operational Pitfalls]]
7. Airport Operations (ACS III.A and III.B)
	1. Q&A to feel out weak areas in understanding of [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]] and [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations]]
	2. [[Part 830]] review: [[Accident and Incident Reporting]]
	3. Use of portable electronic devices (see [[AC 91-21]])

Flight instructor goes to tahoe "for training" but it's not really to train, more for student
