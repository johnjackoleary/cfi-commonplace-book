### Objective
Develop knowledge, risk management and skills associated with accelerated stalls.

### References
- [[Commercial ACS]] Sec VII.D
- [[AFH Ch5]], 
- [[PHAK Ch4]]
- [[POH]]

### Builds On
- [[CPL.10 Slow Flight and Stalls]]
- [[PPL.8 Power-On and Power-Off Stalls]]

### Schedule
0.5-hour ground, 1.0-hour flight, with practice on multiple flights

### Lesson Elements
1. Review the aerodynamic principles
	1. Stall background same as [[PPL.8 Power-On and Power-Off Stalls]]
	2. Why do we experience increased load factor in a level banked turn?
	3. Why does stall speed increase with load factor?  By how much?
	4. Why are stall in a banked turn dangerous
	5. Per the ACS, you need to understand the relationship between angle of attack, airspeed, load factor, power setting, airplane weight and center of gravity, airplane attitude, and yaw effects.
	6. What is stall speed at 45°, no flaps, in your airplane?
2. Accelerated stall procedure
	1. Select practice area, clear the area, altitude 3000’ AGL minimum RECOVERY altitude.
	2. Establish 45 degree bank turn (at relatively low speed/power, definitely below V<sub>A</sub>)
	3. Use rudder to maintain coordinated flight (ball in center)
	4. Gradual pitch up until first indication of a stall (stall horn, buffet, etc). Verbally acknowledge the indications.  Don’t do a full-stall!
	5. Recovery:
		1. Pitch down
		2. Full power
		3. Level wings (primarily rudder, ailerons also as airspeed increases)
		4. Pitch up to establish climb at V<sub>X</sub> or V<sub>Y</sub>
		5. Return to altitude, heading, and airspeed specified by the examiner
3. Common Errors:
	1. Starting maneuver at too-high airspeed, causing lots of time, climb, and /or g-force to get to the accelerated stall.
	2. Not maintaining rudder coordination, causing wing to drop during stall, entering spin!
	3. Delay in stall recovery, causing excessive altitude loss or spin entry
	4. Secondary stall due to aggressive pitch up during recovery

### Completion Standards
Client must understand and be able to demonstrate impending accelerated stalls to [[Commercial ACS]]. Recovery no lower than 3000’ AGL, speed below V<sub>A</sub>, acknowledge impending stall, and recover as specified by the examiner.
