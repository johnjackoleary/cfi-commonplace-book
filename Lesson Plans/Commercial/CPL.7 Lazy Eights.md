### Lesson Elements
1. Concepts in a lazy eight
	1. The lazy eight is a maneuver that is designed to develop the proper coordination of the flight controls across a wide range of airspeeds and attitudes.
	2. Similar to an S-Turn, a lazy eight is two or more opposing 180° turns. The lazy eight adds both a climb and descent to each 180° segment (first 90° is the climb, the second 90° is the descent).
	3. As we climb, we lose airspeed, which results in a smaller radius turn. This smaller radius turn causes a more pronounced [[Overbanking Tendency]]. Normally we counter this with opposite aileron, but in a lazy eight, we use it to slowly increase bank through the maneuver.
	4. The slower airspeed, climb, and bank requires attention on the rudder due to the [[Four Left Turning Tendencies]]. This is especially pronounced in right turns.
3. Maneuver setup
	1. Clear the area.
	2. Select an altitude that will allow the maneuver to be performed no lower than 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL).
	3. Be careful of overlaying Bravo.
	4. Establish the recommended entry configuration, power, and airspeed. (See aircraft-specific maneuver sheets in [[All Maneuvers Quick Reference]])
4. Maneuver ![[Lazy Eight.jpeg]]
	1. Pick reference point off wing (90°) in direction of turn. Reference points at 45° and 135° are also useful.
	2. Establish 5° bank and gradually pitch up (max pitch does not need to be stalling - likely to gain a couple hundred feet)
	4. Constant change of pitch and roll rate and airspeed throughout.
	5. At 45°, reach max pitch-up, with bank 15°
	6. At 90°, reach level pitch and 30° bank
	7. At 135°, max pitch-down, bank 15°
	8. At 180°, level flight, at entry airspeed, at entry altitude
	9. Repeat opposite direction
5. Common Errors
	1. Not clearing the area
	2. Maneuver is not symmetrical across each 180°
	3. Inadequate or improper selection or use of 45°, 90°, 135° references
	4. Ineffective planning
	5. Gain or loss of altitude at each 180° point
	6. Poor control at the top of each climb segment resulting in the pitch rapidly falling through the horizon
	7. Airspeed or bank angle standards not met
	8. Control roughness
	9. Poor flight control coordination
	10. Not scanning for other traffic during the maneuver
	11. Performing by reference to the flight instruments rather than visual references 

### Completion Standards
Client must fly maneuver to [[ACS]] standards: 
- Approximately 30° bank at the steepest point.
- Constant change of pitch and roll rate and airspeed.
- At the 180° point: ±100 feet from entry altitude, ±10 knots from entry airspeed, ±10° from heading.
