- [[Part 830]]
- [[AC 120-12]]
- [[AC 61-142]]
- [[AC 91-67]]

### Resources
- [[Pyramid of Airworthiness]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]
- [[PPL1.5 Towered Airport Operations]]
- [[PPL4.2 Advanced Airport Operations]]

### Schedule
Ground 1.5-3 hours, depending on memory of concepts from [[PPL]]

### Lesson Elements
1. Overview of [[~ CPL Lesson Plan Outline|Commercial Syllabus]]
2. Overview on Commercial License
	1. *"A commercial pilot may be compensated for flying"* - [[PHAK Ch1]]
	2. **Operations/Systems**: Thorough understanding of systems and higher standards for operations
	3. **Regulations**: Introduction of commercial operations requires a wider and deeper understanding of the [[FAR]]s
	4. **Maneuvers**: [[PPL]] maneuvers are mostly 1 dimensional, [[CPL]] requires maneuvering simultaneously in 2 dimensions
3. [[Commercial ACS]] I. Preflight Preparation
	1. I.A. Pilot Qualifications
		1. Builds on the foundation in [[Complete VFR Preflight Checklist#Pilot]] section
		2. Review [[FAR 61.133]]
		3. May carry persons or property for hire subject to common carriage vs private carriage limitations
		4. [[Private and Commercial Pilot Privileges and Limitation]] #todo :: Add source, maybe [[AC 61-142]]
