### References
- [[AFH Ch10]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL.6 Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 2 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Purpose
	1. The goal is to gain the most altitude possible for a given bank angle and power setting
	2. **However**, the standard used to judge the maneuver is not the amount of altitude gained, but rather the pilot’s proficiency in maximizing climb performance
2. Technique ![[Chandelle.jpeg]]
	1. A maximum performance, 180° climbing turn
	2. Begins from approximately straight-and-level flight 
	3. Concludes with the airplane in a wings-level, nose-high attitude just above stall speed
3. Flying the Maneuver
	1. Clear Area, Start > 1500 AGL, pick 0, 90, and 180 reference points
	2. Establish cruise at Va (or POH recommendation), gear and flaps UP.
	3. Constant-Speed prop – leave at cruise power during maneuver
	4. Enter 30° bank turn, with continuous slow pitch up
	5. Set power: (Fixed-pitch – slowly add full power during pitch up. Constant-Speed prop – leave at cruise power during maneuver)
	6. At 90° point, reach max pitch attitude and hold it
	7. At 180°, roll out and maintain Vs1
	8. Hold momentarily, then recover to cruise flight, maintaining altitude.

### Completion Standards
Learner is able to rollout at the 180° point, ±10°, and just above a stall airspeed, then maintain that airspeed momentarily while avoiding a stall. Recover to cruise flight, maintaining altitude.
