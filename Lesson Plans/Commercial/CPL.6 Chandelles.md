### Objective
Understand purpose and procedures of a chandelle. Develop skills required to execute a chandelle to ACS standards.

- [[SOLO.6 Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]

### Schedule
Ground 0.5 hours, Flight 2 hours

### Lesson Elements
1. Purpose
	1. The goal is to gain the most altitude possible for a given bank angle and power setting
	2. **However**, the standard used to judge the maneuver is not the amount of altitude gained, but rather the pilot’s proficiency in maximizing climb performance
2. Technique ![[Chandelle.jpeg]]
	1. A maximum performance, 180° climbing turn
	2. Begins from approximately straight-and-level flight 
	3. Concludes with the airplane in a wings-level, nose-high attitude just above stall speed
3. Flying the Maneuver
	1. Clear Area, Start > 1500 AGL, pick 0, 90, and 180 reference points
	2. Establish cruise at Va (or POH recommendation), gear and flaps UP.
	3. Constant-Speed prop – leave at cruise power during maneuver
	4. Enter 30° bank turn, with continuous slow pitch up
	5. Set power: (Fixed-pitch – slowly add full power during pitch up. Constant-Speed prop – leave at cruise power during maneuver)
	6. At 90° point, reach max pitch attitude and hold it
	7. From the 90° point to the 180° point, continuously reduce bank angle from 30° back to wings level, while maintaining that same max pitch attitude
	8. Wings should become level just as the 180° point is reached.  Airspeed should be just above Vs1
	9. Hold Vs1 momentarily, then recover to cruise flight, maintaining altitude.

### Common Errors
- Letting pitch increase too quickly at the onset of the maneuver
- Letting the pitch sag during the second half of the maneuver
- Rolling out too suddenly

### Completion Standards
Learner is able to rollout at the 180° point, ±10°, and just above a stall airspeed, then maintain that airspeed momentarily while avoiding a stall. Recover to cruise flight, maintaining altitude.
