### Lesson Elements
1. Pilot
	1. Aeromedical Factors
		1. Oxygen (legal and practical)
		2. Hydration
		3. Fatigue
		4. Illusions
	2. Survival Equipment
	3. Periodic Self Checkins ([[IMSAFE]])
	4. [[Personal Minimums]]
2. Aircraft
	1. Performance at High [[Density Altitude]]
		1. Be wary of [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]
		2. Takeoff/Landing Calculations
			1. [[50-70 Rule]]
			2. Higher [[True Airspeed]] on landing, same [[Indicated Airspeed]]
		3. Climb performance degradation
			1. May require circling to gain altitude
			2. May not be able to out climb [[downdraft]] (best to push forward out of it, similar to ocean riptides)
	3. Selecting an aircraft for the mission
	4. Weight considerations
		1. 90% of [[MGW]] recommended
3. Environment
	1. Winds at Peaks
	2. Seasonal Considersations
		1. Summer -- [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]
		2. Winter -- Survival and options for emergency landings
	3. Wx information
		1. [[Weather Brief]]
		2. [[Area Forecast Discussion]]
		3. Contact someone at the destination airport
		4. Be wary -- mountain weather can change quickly!
