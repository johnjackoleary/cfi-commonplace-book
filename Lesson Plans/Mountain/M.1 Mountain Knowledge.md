### Schedule

### Lesson Elements
1. Preflight Considerations
	1. Pilot
		1. Aeromedical Factors
			1. Oxygen (legal, practical, and at night)
			2. Hydration
			3. Fatigue
			4. Illusions
		2. Survival Equipment
		3. Periodic Self Checkins ([[IMSAFE]])
		4. [[Personal Minimums]]
	2. Aircraft
		1. Performance at High [[Density Altitude]]
			1. Be wary of [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]
			2. Takeoff/Landing Calculations
				1. [[50-70 Rule]]
				2. Higher [[True Airspeed]] and [[GS]] on landing, same [[Indicated Airspeed]]
			3. Climb performance degradation
				1. May require circling to gain altitude
				2. May not be able to out climb [[downdraft]] (best to push forward out of it, similar to ocean riptides)
			4. Remember that Vx and Vy converge at higher altitudes ([[Vx vs Vy at Higher Altitudes.jpeg|image]])
		2. Selecting an aircraft for the mission
		3. Weight & Balance considerations
			1. 90% of [[MGW]] recommended
			2. Impact of aft CG
	3. Environment
		1. Calculating [[Density Altitude]] and why it matters
		2. Time of day
			1. Often better in morning (cooler, less winds, less turbulent)
			2. Many folks prefer not to fly after noon
		3. Seasonal Considersations
			1. Summer -- [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]
			2. Winter -- Survival and options for emergency landings
		4. Wx information
			1. [[Weather Brief]]
			2. [[Area Forecast Discussion]]
			3. Contact someone at the destination airport
			4. Be wary -- mountain weather can change quickly!
		5. Specific weather factors
			1. Visibility, clouds
			2. Thunderstorms
			3. Winds at peaks, roll clouds, mountain waves
				1. Rule of thumb for winds >25 kts at peaks
	4. External Pressures - Standard, but different solutions may be available
		1. E.g. Too much weight can be resolved by taking multiple trips from high to low elevation airports, then departing as a group from the low altitude airport
2. Go/No-Go Decision
	1. Factors of [[PAVE]] above, and how they relate to your [[Personal Minimums]]
	2. Abort on takeoff roll for insufficient power ([[50-70 Rule]])
3. Flight Considerations
	1. Preparation
		1. Survival in off airport landing
			1. Equipment
			2. Priorities and survival techniques
			3. [[ELT]]s and [[PLB]]s
		3. Value of using flight plans (and issues closing them at remote airports)
	2. Planning
		1. Detailed route plan to avoid [[box canyon]]s or other dangerous locations
		2. Consider emergency landing options
		3. Check departure procedures for local obstructions
		4. Alternative airports
	3. Taxi
		1. Leaning procedure
	4. Runup
		1. Leaning procedure for takeoff
	5. Takeoff -- will take longer!
		1. Power Settings
		2. Short Field Technique
	6. Climb/Enroute/Descent
		1. Updraft and Downdrafts
		2. Flying along valleys -- choose a side, not the middle!
		3. Ridge crossing at 45Â° angles
	7. Traffic Pattern
		1. May be irregular for surrounding terrain (see [[L05]] -- helpful to check Google Maps/Earth before going
		2. May be on top of ridge (see [[KAVX]]) with unique illusions
		3. Higher [[GS]] considerations
			1. Careful not to overshoot final
			2. Plan descent carefully
	8. Landing -- will feel fast!
		1. Leaning procedure
		2. Expect higher [[GS]] and [[True Airspeed]], but same [[Indicated Airspeed]]
