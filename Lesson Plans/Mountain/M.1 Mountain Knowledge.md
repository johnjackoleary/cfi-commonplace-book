### Lesson Elements
1. What counts as mountain flying?
	> [!quote] From [[Tips on Mountain Flying]]
	>  Rather than offer a definition of "mountain" flying, it should be pointed out that many of the subjects discussed in this publication can be found in nonmountainous areas or at low altitudes. For example, density altitudes over 8,500 feet can be found regularly on the eastern plains of Colorado in the summer. Also, dangerous mechanical turbulence and even mountain wave can be found in areas that aren't usually considered mountainous.
2. Basic Premises of Mountain Flying
   > [!summary] From [[Mountain Flying Bible]]
   > 1. Always remain in a position where you can turn toward lowering terrain.
   > 2. Never fly beyond the [[point of no return]].
3. Preflight Considerations
	1. Pilot
		1. Aeromedical Factors
			1. Oxygen (legal, practical, and at night)
			2. [[Dehydration]]
			3. Fatigue
			4. #Illusions
		2. Equipment
			1. Survival
				1. Air Search and Rescue won' begin until daylight; chances are good of spending at least one night outdoors
				2. [Striving to Survive](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/airman_education/topics_of_interest/survive) has a good list of equipment to consider
				3. Priorities and survival techniques
				4. [[PLB]]s
			2. Enroute
				1. Pulse oximeter
				2. Water
		3. Periodic Self Checkins ([[IMSAFE]])
		4. [[Personal Minimums]]
	2. Aircraft
		1. Performance at High [[Density Altitude]]
			1. Be wary of [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]
			2. Takeoff/Landing Calculations
				1. [[50-70 Rule]]
				2. Higher [[TAS]] and [[GS]] on landing, same [[IAS]]
			3. Climb performance degradation
				1. May require circling to gain altitude ([[Shuttle Climb]])
				2. May not be able to out climb [[downdraft]] (best to push forward out of it, similar to ocean riptides)
			4. Power and performance impacts
				1. Power in normally aspirated engines decreases 3% for every 1000'^[From [[Mountain Flying]]]
			2. Service ceiling consideration
				1. Remember that Vx and Vy converge at higher altitudes ([[Vx vs Vy at Higher Altitudes.jpeg|image]])
		2. Selecting an aircraft for the mission
			1. Some experts recommend that 160 horsepower should be considered the absolute minimum for the airplane, especially when the pilot lacks significant mountain flying experience. 
		3. Weight & Balance considerations
			1. 90% of [[MGW]] recommended
			2. Impact of aft CG
		4. Equipment
			1. Best to test [[ELT]] before departing (More info from [[AOPA]] [here](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2017/february/flight-training-magazine/how-it-works-elt#:~:text=You%20can%20test%20your%20121.5,the%20first%20order%20of%20business.)) - average time to find down aircraft with ELT is 6.8hr, compared to 40.7hr without^[https://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/airman_education/topics_of_interest/search_rescue]
	3. Environment
		1. Account for [[Density Altitude]]
		2. Time of day
			1. Often better in morning (cooler, less winds, less turbulent)
			2. Many folks prefer not to fly after noon
		3. Seasonal Considerations
			1. Summer -- [[Hot, High, and Heavy]]
			2. Winter -- Survival and options for emergency landings
		4. Wx information
			1. [[Weather Brief]]
			2. [[Area Forecast Discussion]]
			3. Contact someone at the destination airport
			4. Be wary -- mountain weather can change quickly!
		5. Specific weather factors
			1. Visibility
			2. Clouds
				1. [[Mountain Wave]] Signs![[Mountain Waves and Associated Clouds.jpeg]]
				3. [[Kelvin–Helmholtz Cloud]]s
			3. [[Thunderstorm]]s
				1. [[Roll Cloud]]s
			4. Winds at peaks
				1. Rule of thumb for winds >25 kts at peaks (from [[Tips on Mountain Flying]])
				2. Increased likelihood of [[Mountain Wave]]
	4. External Pressures - Standard, but different solutions may be available
		1. E.g. Too much weight can be resolved by taking multiple trips from high to low elevation airports, then departing as a group from the low altitude airport
2. Go/No-Go Decision and [[ADM]]
	1. Factors of [[PAVE]] above, and how they relate to your [[Personal Minimums]]
	2. Consider Canceling if (additional recommendations from [[Back to Basics - Tips to Mountain Flying]])
		1. [[IMC]]
		2. Darkness falls before flight completed
		3. Winds more than 30kts at mountain tops
		4. Unsuitable airport conditions
	3. Abort on takeoff roll for insufficient power ([[50-70 Rule]])
3. Flight Considerations
	1. Preparation
		1. Survival for off airport landing
		3. Value of using flight plans (and issues closing them at remote airports)
			> [!quote] [Search and Rescue](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/airman_education/topics_of_interest/search_rescue) by Rogers V. Shaw, III
			> If a flight plan is filed, the air traffic control system will automatically initiate a plan to locate overdue flights. When an aircraft on a VFR flight plan is overdue by 1 hour, or by 30 minutes on a IFR flight plan, the Flight Service Station servicing the destination airport issues an INREQ (Information Request). If a flight plan was not filed, there is no designated time limit before a search is initiated, thus greatly delaying the onset of Search and Rescue.
	2. Planning
		1. Detailed route plan to avoid [[box canyon]]s or other dangerous locations
		2. Consider emergency landing options
		3. [[Chart Supplement]]
		4. Check departure procedures for local obstructions
		5. Alternative airports
	3. Runup
		1. Leaning procedure for takeoff (always follow POH, generally in mountains use full power runup and lean find peak power)
	4. Takeoff/Climb -- will take longer!
		1. Power Settings
		2.  [[SOLO.16 Short- and Soft-Field Takeoffs and Landings|Short Field Technique]]
		3. May need to [[shuttle climb]]
	5. Enroute
		1. Important to know wind direction (both from preflight and from signs while flying)
		2. Updraft and Downdrafts
		3. Flying along valleys -- choose a side, preferably updraft side, not the middle!
		4. Box Canyons
			1. Never fly up a canyon that you haven't already flown down so you know there's room to turn around
			2. NEVER try to out climb the terrain in ANY airplane
			3. Make sure canyon is sufficiently wide given your turn radius
			4. [[Box Canyon Turn]] technique
		5. Ridges
			1. Fly at least 1000' above, and be there 3 miles before you arrive (although 2000' often results in less turbulence)
			2. If you can't see terrain beyond the pass, you're too low to pass
			3. Approach crossing at 45° angles so better able to turn around, then depart at 90° angle
		6. [[CFIT]]
		7. Be comfortable stopping early if conditions deteriorate
		8. Hazard Advisor tools
	6. Descent/Traffic Pattern
		1. May be irregular for surrounding terrain (see [[L05]] -- helpful to check Google Maps/Earth before going)
		2. May be on top of ridge (see [[KAVX]]) with unique illusions
		3. Higher [[GS]] considerations
			1. Careful not to overshoot final
			2. Plan descent carefully
		4. Be aware if airport doesn't allow for go arounds
	7. Landing -- will feel fast!
		1. Leaning procedure
		2. Expect higher [[GS]] and [[TAS]], but same [[IAS]]

### Completion Standards
Learner understands the unique considerations required for mountain flying. They are able to apply these considerations while planning subsequent mountain flying.

### Required Homework
- [ ] Prepare for upcoming mountain flight

### Recommended Homework 
- [ ] Monitor the weather as the flight gets closer^[Forecasts too far out can be surprisingly inaccurate. It's good to see this in practice for a training flight, because knowing how to account for these issues will be relevant in future flights.]
