Depending on the learner's goals, a mountain checkout can be coupled with a [[WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program|WINGS]] flight review.

See [Air Safety Institute, Focused Flight Review: Mountain and Backcountry Flying](https://www.faasafety.gov/WINGS/pub/accreditedactivities/accreditedActivityViewer.aspx?aaid=%2051230) from [[AOPA]] to learn more about this.

> [!note]
> This will likely require a few more tasks than a normal mountain checkout, but may be perfect if the learner also needs a flight review.
