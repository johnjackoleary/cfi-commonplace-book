> [!note] From Jack
> While not the only way, here is how I prefer to checkout a new aircraft.

> [!tip]
> Checkout flights could be structured to cover [[WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program|WINGS]] activities, and later used as part of a [[~ WINGS Flight Review]].

## General Approach
### Ground Work Before First Flight
- [ ] Read [[POH]] for this aircraft and its avionics
- [ ] Create initial [[Gait Chart]] based on [[POH]] to be confirmed in first few flights
- [ ] Set up [[ForeFlight]] profile and glide info^[[ForeFlight equipment codes](https://support.foreflight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049193173-ICAO-Equipment-and-PBN-Code-Setup-Guide) may be useful]
- [ ] Complete ground review form with school
- [ ] Purchase, find, or create a checklist you plan to use

### First Flight
- [ ] Find an instructor knowledgeable in the aircraft and set up a lesson
- [ ] Practice all stages of flight and [[PPL.D Suggestions for Solo Flight Practice|maneuvers]]
- [ ] Note parts of the checklist and areas of your [[Gait Chart]] that should be updated

### After First Flight
- [ ] Review ground form with instructor
- [ ] Practice avionics and/or aircraft in sim, if able

### Subsequent Flights with Instructor
- [ ] Use and improve your checklists/gaits
- [ ] Practice all emergencies, especially procedures different from planes you already know
- [ ] Practice instrument procedures, if applicable
- [ ] Your instructor will tell you when they feel you're ready to fly on your own, depending on the complexity of the aircraft

### Subsequent Flights without Instructor
- [ ] Practice with all avionics and their features on the ground
- [ ] Practice all [[PPL.D Suggestions for Solo Flight Practice|private]] (and [[CPL.C Ideas for Solo Commercial Practice|commercial]], if you know them) maneuvers to develop proficiency at various speeds/attitudes
- [ ] File and fly [[IFR]], even in [[VMC]], if applicable
- [ ] Fly many full stop patterns, until able to consistently meet ACS standards
