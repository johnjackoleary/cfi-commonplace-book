> [!note] From Jack
> While not the only way, here is how I prefer to checkout a new aircraft.

## General Approach
### Ground Work Before First Flight
- [ ] Read [[POH]] for this aircraft and its avionics
- [ ] Create initial [[Gait Chart]] based on [[POH]] to be confirmed in first few flights
- [ ] Set up foreflight profile and glide info
- [ ] Complete ground review form with school.
- [ ] Purchase, find, or create a checklist you plan to use

### First Flight
- [ ] Find an instructor knowledgeable in the aircraft and set up a lesson
- [ ] Practice all stages of flight, noting parts of the checklist to update later
- [ ] Note areas of your [[Gait Chart]] that should be updated

### After First Flight
- [ ] Review ground form with instructor
- [ ] Practice avionics and/or aircraft in sim, if you'd like

### Subsequent Flights with Instructor
- [ ] Use and improve your checklists/gaits
- [ ] Practice all emergencies, especially new procedures from planes you already know
- [ ] You instructor will tell you when they feel your ready to fly on your own, depending on the complexity of the aircraft

### Subsequent Flights without Instructor
- [ ] Practice with all avionics and their features on the ground
- [ ] Practice all private (and commercial, if you know them) maneuvers to develop proficiency at various speeds/attitudes 
- [ ] Fly many full stop patterns, until able to consistently meet ACS standards
