### Lesson Elements
- Handling the Emergency
	- Remain calm, ***you've got this***
	- Go through the [Emergency Checklist](https://www.aopa.org/-/media/files/aopa/home/pilot-resources/asi/safety-syllabi/pinchhitter.pdf#page=15) from [[AOPA]]
- Generally, think about [[Aviate, Navigate, Communicate]]
	- Aviate
		- Fly the airplane. 
		- If it's on autopilot, let it on. If it's off, leave it off.
	- Navigate
		- Follow ATC instructions or use or GPS to navigate to an airport.
	- Communicate
		- Let ATC know what is happening on 121.5.
		- They are here to help you.
- Parachutes, if available
	- Cirrus Aircraft, and some others, have a Ballistic Recovery System ([[BRS]])
	- Activate by pulling the handle
	- After activation, turn off the engine
- Landing the airplane
	- Fly to the point you are aiming for. This point should stay stationary in your windshield.
	- Maintain proper airspeed control. The middle of the white arc is a good target, if unsure.
