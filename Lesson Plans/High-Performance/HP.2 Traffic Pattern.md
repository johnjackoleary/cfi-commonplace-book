### Objective
Build ground knowledge required to preflight and operate a high-performance (greater than 200 [[HP]]) engine safely and proficiently. Begin applying this knowledge to traffic pattern operations.

### Reading
- [[AFH Ch12]]

### Resources
- [Pelican's Perch](https://www.avweb.com/topics/features/avweb-classics/pelicans-perch/) of [[AVweb]], especially #15, #16, and #19^[Might require the use of archive.org, e.g. for [#15](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112024522/https://www.avweb.com/features_old/pelicans-perch-15manifold-pressure-sucks/) and [#16](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021057/www.avweb.com/features_old/pelicans-perch-16those-marvelous-props/)]
- [Managing the Engine](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/students/solo/skills/managing-the-engine) by [[AOPA]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]
- [[PPL2.6 Aircraft Systems]]

### Schedule
1.5hr ground, flights until proficient

### Lesson Elements
- Review of club checkout forms, if applicable
- Apply theory from [[HP.1 Theory, Maneuvers, and Emergencies]] to flying the traffic pattern
- We'll use 20-20-10 today in the pattern to practice (20" MP, 2000 RPM, 10 GPH)
- Practice short, soft, forward slip, and power-off landings

### Completion Standards
Learner preflights and flies several laps in the pattern using proper procedures for a constant-speed propeller and a high-performance engine. They demonstrate short, soft, forward slip, and power-off landings.
