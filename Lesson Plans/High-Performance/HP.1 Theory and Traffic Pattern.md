### Objective
Build ground knowledge required to preflight and operate a high-performance (greater than 200 HP) engine safely and proficiently. Begin applying this knowledge to traffic pattern operations.

### Reading
- [[AFH Ch12]]

### Resources
- [Pelican's Perch](https://www.avweb.com/topics/features/avweb-classics/pelicans-perch/) of [[AVweb]], especially #15 and #19^[Might require the use of archive.org, e.g. for [#15](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112024522/https://www.avweb.com/features_old/pelicans-perch-15manifold-pressure-sucks/)]
- [Managing the Engine](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/students/solo/skills/managing-the-engine) by [[AOPA]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL1.1 Aircraft Preflight, Taxiing, and Postflight Procedures]]
- [[PPL2.6 Aircraft Systems]]

### Schedule
1.5hr ground, flights until proficient

### Lesson Elements
#### Constant Speed Propellers
- Theory: [Great article](https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/aircraft-systems/how-a-constant-speed-prop-works/) from [[Bold Method]]
	- [[MP]] background
	- Danger of high MP and low RPM
	- Throttle control difference in fixed-pitch vs constant speed
	- If loss of oil pressure, which pitch does the propeller fail to?
- Preflight planning
	- Selection of MP and RPM for cruise flight^[Good overview [here](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/1998/november/flight-training-magazine/engine-power-settings) from [[AOPA]]]
		- > [!note] From Jack: 
		  I've heard the reason for choosing low RPM in cruise is to reduce energy loss to friction. I haven't been able to confirm this though,^[Let me know if you have a source for this!] and treat it more like a memory aid.
	- Preparing speed, power, and configurations for key stages of flight (see [[Aircraft Gait Charts]] for examples)
- Preflight testing
	- Cycling the propeller in run-up
- Departure
	- Know engine takeoff limits, e.g. reduce RPM within 5 minutes
	- Pitching for a cruise climb to improve engine cooling
	- Importance of checklists for each stage of flight, especially with more advanced systems
- En Route
	- Order of changing power settings ("[[Don't Crush The Egg]]")
- Descent
	- Shock cooling
		- avoid changes in MP >5MP at a time (this will require additional descent planning)
		- alternatively, 1" MP per 1 minute is a good #rule-of-thumb 
	- Avoid power-off descents, even through the end of the traffic pattern, as a full-power go-around with a cool engine can cause the engine to falter
	- If you do need to idle the engine, try to 'clear' it every 15 seconds or so to keep it warm
- Pattern
	- Many HP aircraft require flaps deployed before entry into the traffic pattern -- abeam the numbers may not give time to slow down
	- Impact of heavier nose in round out -- lack of airspeed over threshold ('chop and drop') may not give enough energy to round out
- Go-Arounds
	- Smooth power application
	- [[4 C's (Go-Around)]] or [[5 C's (Going Missed)]]
- IFR Considerations
	- Slow to an approach speed early -- a couple miles before [[IAF]]
	- If you're falling behind the plane, go missed and try again

	  Unless there is some **limitation** in the POH, climb at WOT (Wide Open Throttle), 100 or 200 RPM below the max (for noise), full-rich mixture and cowl flaps open (cooling), or cowl flaps as called for in the manual. You can’t go wrong doing this. **Monitor** your CHTs, preferably on a modern all-cylinder monitor, and if **any** CHT goes above 380°F to 400°F, **do something about it**. There are several things you can do. The most effective one is to lower the nose and increase airspeed. Open the cowl flaps if they’re not already open. Enrich the mixture, if you’re ROP (or lean it more if LOP). If you’re already full rich, this might be a good time to turn on the boost pump to “LOW” (if available) or “HIGH” to increase the fuel flow. With the boost running, you may get too much fuel, and the cure for this is to lean a little. All of these will reduce climb performance, but unless you’re about to hit something, it always makes sense to take the “hit” on climb rate in order to keep the engine nice and cool.<br>
	  No matter what your POH says, limitation or otherwise, I suggest you consider 400°F an absolute redline CHT on any cylinder with a bayonet probe feeding an all-cylinder monitor (spark plug thermocouple types may show higher). There is mounting evidence that factory limits on CHT are much too high. In any event, try to keep the time above such temperatures at a minimum.

#### Traffic Pattern
- Apply theory above to flying the traffic pattern
- Practice short, soft, forward slip, and power-off landings

### Completion Standards
Learner preflights and flies several laps in the pattern using proper procedures for a constant-speed propeller and a high-performance engine. They demonstrate short, soft, forward slip, and power-off landings.
