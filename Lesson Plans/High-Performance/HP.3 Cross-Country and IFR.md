### Objective
Become familiar with all avionics and instrumentation available for a cross-country flight. If applicable, learn IFR procedures for this aircraft.

> [!tip] This is can be combined with a [[M.2 Mountain Flight|mountain flight]] during a mountain checkout.

### Resources
- [[Instrument ACS]]

### Builds On
- [[PPL4.1 Intro to Cross Country Flying]]
- [[HP.1 Theory and Traffic Pattern]]
- [[HP.2 Departing the Airport, Maneuvers, and Emergencies]]

### Schedule
0.5hr ground^[this may require more ground time, depending on how prepared the learner is to use the new instruments], 2.5hr flight

### Lesson Elements
- Overview of any new avionics or tools in the flight deck
- If applicable, discussion of instrument procedures ([[Aircraft Gait Charts]] may be useful)
- XC flight to practice (consider 3 airports for VFR+IFR, 2 airports for VFR only)
	- VFR to the first destination, simulated IMC with practice approach to an intermediate airport returning, missed approach, and another approach into home airport.

### Completion Standards
Learner demonstrates an understanding of all tools available in the aircraft. If applicable, the learner performs instrument approaches to ACS standards.
