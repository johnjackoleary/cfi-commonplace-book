## Power-On and Power-Off Stalls

**Objective:** Develop knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with power-on and power-off stalls
**References:** ACS Sec VII-B and -C, AFH Ch 4, PHAK Ch 5, POH
**Builds On:** [[Maneuvering During Slow Flight]]
**Schedule:** 0.5-hour ground, 1.0-hour flight, with practice on multiple flights
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Aerodynamics of stalls
	1. Stall occurs at critical angle of attack
	2. Stall can occur at ANY airspeed, attitude, or power setting!
	3. Discuss effect of gear, flaps, weight, CG, load factor, bank angle
2. Situations where risk of stalls increase
	1. Landing approach, especially skidding base to final turn
	2. Climb-out, trying to clear an obstacle, especially at high density altitude
	3. Emergency landing, power-off glide, trying to stretch the glide
	4. Exceeding mass gross, CG out of limits
	5. Ice or frost accumulation on wings
3. Stall recognition
	1. Sight - high pitch attitude (not always)
	2. Sound - reduced airflow, less wind noise
	3. Feel - mushy controls, less effective
4. Power-off stall procedure
	1. Select practice area, check traffic, altitude 3000' AGL minimum
	2. Establish stable descent in landing configuration at 1.3 Vso (gear, flaps power, carb heat, etc), straight or turning as requested
	3. Use rudder to maintain coordinated flight (ball in center)
	4. Gradual pitch up until stall occurs
	5. Recovery:
		1. Pitch down
		2. Full power
		3. Level wings (primarily with rudder, ailerons also as airspeed increases)
		4. Pitch up to establish climb at Vx
	6. Power-on stall procedure
		1. Select practice area, check traffic, altitude 3000' AGL minimum
		2. Reduce power to slow down, maintaining altitude
		3. Configure aircraft for take-offf/climb configuration, straight or turning as requested
		4. At Vx, add full power and pitch up to climb
		5. Use rudder to maintain coordinated flight (ball in center)
		6. Gradual pitch up until stall occurs
		7. Recovery
			1. Pitch down to break stall
			2. Level wings (aileron/rudder)
			3. Pitch up to establish climb at Vx
		8. Common errors:
			1. Not maintaining rudder coordination, causing wing to drop during stall, entering spin!
			2. Delay in stall recovery, causing excessive altitude loss or spin entry
			3. Secondary stall due to aggressive pitch up during recovery

**Completion Standards:** Client must be able to demonstrate power-off and power-on stalls, to ACS standards. Recovery no lower than 1500' AGL, maintain heading &plusmn;10 degrees before stall, or specified bank angle &plusmn;10 degrees, recognize stall and recover promptly with proper procedure.
