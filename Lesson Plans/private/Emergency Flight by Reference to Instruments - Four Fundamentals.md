## Emergency Flight by Reference to Instruments - Four Fundamentals

**Objective:** Develop knowledge and skills required for emergency flight by reference to instruments.
**References:** Instrument Flying Handbook Ch 6-7; AFH Ch 17; ACS section VIII
**Builds On:** [[Four Fundamentals of Flight]]
**Schedule:** Ground 1.0, Flight/Sim 1.0, frequent practice on multiple flights
**CFI Equipment:** Hood or foggles
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Introduction to Instrument Scan (ground portion)
	1. Primary and supporting instruments
	2. Instrument Scan
		1. Control and performance instruments
		2. Instrument cross-check, types of scans
		3. 4-step scan procedure (Butcher) to initiate any maneuver
			1. Set approximate attitude and power
			2. Inverted V-scan to check trends
			3. Scan primary instruments
			4. Scan all instruments
2. Attitude instrument flight pasics
	1. Power-Pitch-Time sequence to initiate climb, Pitch-Power-Trim for descent.
	2. Straight and Level flight (IFH 7-2)
	3. Straight climbs and descents (IFH 7-14)
	4. Turns (IFH 7-19)
3. Common errors
	1. Spatial disorientation
	2. Distraction
	3. Fixation or omission
	4. While turning -- watch the turn, and do nothing else until complete
	5. Heavy touching, over-controlling
	6. Improper trim control

**Completion Standards:** Client must demonstrate basic attitude instrument flying skills, to ACS standards (&plusmn;200 feet, heading &plusmn;20 degrees, airspeed &plusmn;10 knots). Maneuvers will include straight-and-level, turn to headings, and perform constant airspeed clims and descents, by reference to flight instruments only.

**Required Homework:** None

**Recommended Homework:** 
- [ ] Chair fly four fundamentals using image of instruments. What do you expect to see changing in each for each maneuver?
