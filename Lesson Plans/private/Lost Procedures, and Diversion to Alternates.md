## Lost Procedures, and Diversion to Alternates

**Objective:** Develop skills and procedures to identify aircraft location, with on-board charts or equipment or with ATC help, and plan diversion to an appropriate alternate airport.
**References:** PHAK Ch. 16; ACS VI-C (diversion) and VI-D (lost procedures)
**Builds On:** [[Pilotage and Dead Reckoning]], [[Weather Information and Cross-Country Flight Planning]], [[Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]], [[Navigation Systems, including Radar Services]]
**Schedule:** Ground 1.0, Flight 1.0, frequent practice on multiple flights
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Lost procedures
	1. Might be appropriate to circle and/or gain altitude for better view of landmarks. Some use the 5 C's: Climb, Circle, Conserve (fuel), Communicate/Confess, Comply
	2. Use of charts and pilotage to find location
	3. Use of GPS nearest airport feature, or VORs
	4. How to get ATC assistance
2. Plan diversion to alternate airport
	1. Use of GPS direct-to feature
	2. Use of VOR navigation, such as crossing VOR radials
	3. Use of charts (paper or electronic) to estimate distance and heading to alternate
	4. Estimate distance, heading, time enroute, and fuel burn to alternate airport
3. In-flight practice
	1. CFI will get learner "lost", typically after maneuvering with the hood during simulated instrument flight
	2. Learner will demonstrate ability to find location, plan route to an alternate airport, and fly to and land at alternate.

**Completion Standards:** Client should be able to use multiple means to identify location, and to plan route to an alternate airport, including estimate of distance, time, and fuel usage to the alternate.

**Required Homework:** None

**Recommended Homework:** 
- [ ] Many GPS devices have a free simulator to practice with, which is useful to build proficiency
