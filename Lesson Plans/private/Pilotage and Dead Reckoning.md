## Pilotage and Dead Reckoning

**Objective:** Develop knowledge and skills associated with pilotage navigation by reference to charts, and dead reckoning navigation with reference to clock and compass, including expected wind correction.
**References:** PHAK Ch 16 (Navigation)
**Builds On:** [[Navigation Charts and National Airspace System]]
**Schedule:** Ground 1.0, Flight â€“ multiple during dual cross-country flights
**CFI Equipment:** E6-B
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Pilotage
	1. Reading charts, and navigating by visual landmarks
	2. Following flight plans
2. Dead reckoning
	1. Navigation by direction, airspeed, distance and time
	2. Flight log forms, and updating during flight
	3. Mental arithmetic - time, speed, distance

**Completion Standards:** Client should be able to fly a cross country route, using dead reckoning and pilotage, visually identifying each waypoint, and recording actual time of arrival. Client should be able to update the navigation plan in-flight to account for variations in heading and groundspeed due to unforecasted winds.

**Required Homework:** 
- [ ] Plan flight to Kingdon Airpark (O20), or other airport >=51nm away^[This distanace makes the flight count as cross-country, which requires a straightline distance of at least 50nm. We'll use 51nm minimum, to make the checkride smoother, but in your own flights >=50nm can count as cross-country.]

**Recommended Homework:** None
