## Flying the Traffic Pattern

**Objective:** Develop knowledge of airport traffic patterns (towered and non-towered), skill and judgement in approaching and departing various types of patterns, and good procedures while flying the pattern and approach to landing
**References:** ACS Sec III, AFH Ch 7, AIM 4-3
**Builds On:** [[Airport Operations (Ground and Tower Communications, Ground Ops, Light Gun Signals)]], [[Performance Maneuvers - Ground Reference Maneuvers]]
**CFI Equipment:** GPS/Sentry/ADS-B In
**Schedule:** 1-hour ground, 1.5 hours flight
**Lesson Elements:**
1. Review charted information on Sectionals, Chart Supplements, other information sources
2. Palo Alto traffic procedures (as example of airport with Control Tower)
	1. Pattern altitude: 800' on east side, 1000' on west side
	2. Approaching from west: maintain 1500' until crossing 101 freeway
	3. Standard Right Traffic for runway 31, turn right 10 degrees after departure for noise abatement
	4. Common departures: Left and Right Dumbarton, 270 overhead
	5. Visual Reporting points for calling in to KPAO, SLAC, Woodside VOR, Windy Hill, Leslie Salt, Coyote Hills, Sunol Pass, etc....
	6. Flying the pattern -- memorize power settings/airspeeds, use wind correction angle
3. Non-towered airports
	1. CTAF and Unicom frequency, radio usage at non-towered airports
	2. Planning pattern entry (and use of tools like ForeFlight)
	3. Standard traffic patterns to the left, unless charts indicate Right traffic (See "RP 31" for KPAO on sectional)
	4. Overhead entries, and standard 45-degree entry to traffic patterns
4. Other safety concerns
	1. Right of Way rules
	2. Wake turbulence from helicopters, and heavy aircraft
		1. #TODO link helicopter video
	3. Awareness of other operations, such as parachuting
5. Common Errors
	1. Lack of planning ahead, staying ahead of the airplane
	2. Lack of situation awareness or awareness of other traffic
	3. Improper radio usage, forgetting radio calls at non-towered airports

**Completion Standards:** Client must demonstrate proficiency at planning and flying pattern approaches and departures, at towered and non-towered airports, complying with AIM recommended procedures, maintaining awareness of and proper spacing from other aircraft. Maintain traffic pattern altitude &plusmn;100 feet, and airspeed &plusmn;10 knots (or mph).

**Required Homework:**
- [ ] Memorize power settings/airspeeds for pattern #TODO add these for C152/C172/PA28/DA40

**Recommended Homework:** 
- [ ] Chair fly traffic pattern entry
