**Authorization for Completing WINGS Tasks.** An authorized instructor can record completed tasks of WINGS not recorded automatically at www.FAASafety.gov in a logbook or other proficiency record with an endorsement similar to the following. This provides verification for later recording at www.FAASafety.gov by an authorized individual:

*“I certify that (pilot’s name), holder of pilot certificate No. XXXXX, has satisfactorily demonstrated proficiency in the required tasks as outlined in the WINGS—Pilot Proficiency Program, activity number XXX on (date).”*

*“Instructor Name, Certificate Number, Expiration Date, and Signature”*
