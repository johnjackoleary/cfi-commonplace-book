# Completion Criteria
> [!quote] From the Activity Worksheet
> The [[CFI|Flight Instructor]] will ensure the airman possesses the knowledge, ability to manage risks, and skills consistent in the performance of flight maneuvers specifically listed in the Areas of Operation for Takeoffs, Landings and Go-Arounds; Emergency Operations, and Night Operations (as applicable) to the [[ACS]] completion standards. While this ***WINGS*** Flight Activity targets specifically the Takeoff, Landing, and Go-Around Area of Operation, Airmen should satisfactorily demonstrate all pertinent parts of the ACS in their Preflight, Flight, and Post Flight activities consistent with their certificate or rating. <u>For ***[[WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program|WINGS]]*** credit</u>, the airman will satisfactorily demonstrate the maneuvers and procedures listed in bold text below, using both outside visual references and cross checked with the flight instruments, for the privileges of the certificate or rating being exercised in order to act as Pilot-in-Command ([[PIC]]).

# Required Items to Demo to [[ACS]] Standards
> [!note]
> The Activity Worksheet and the Activity Page have slight variations in required items. In particular, Preflight and Postflight Procedures are listed in the Worksheet, but not the Page. This list uses the larger set, as the activity also mentions "the Airman should satisfactorily demonstrate all pertinent parts of the ACS in their Preflight, Flight, and Post Flight activities consistent with their certificate or rating."
