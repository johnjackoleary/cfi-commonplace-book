# WINGS Phase
> [!quote] [WINGS FAQ](https://www.faasafety.gov/OnlineHelp/Default.aspx?page=/WINGS/pub/default.aspx) from [[FAA Safety Team|FAASafety]]
> To complete each Phase, you must earn 6 credits consisting of **3 Knowledge credits** (Courses, Seminars, or Activities) and **3 Flight credits**. The primary focus of each activity determines the applicable credit.

> [!caution]
> Note that all [[WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program|WINGS]] activities, Knowledge and Flight, must be completed within a 12- month period to qualify for completion of a Phase of WINGS.

# Individual Training Activity
## Knowledge Activities
Three knowledge-based activity credits are required for each phase and may consist of courses and/or seminars, either online or in person.

> [!warning]
> You must use the same email address on the external site as you do on FAASafety.gov to get automated WINGS credit!

## Flight Training
Although we recommend you schedule the three Flight Activities over three more-or-less even intervals during a year, you may combine activities in a single day, if you wish.

An activity valued at one (1) credit does not necessarily equal one hour of flight training. Your CFI decides when you have successfully completed this activity and can, in most cases, be shorter than one hour of flight time.

### Activity Details
You can find information about each flight activity on the Quick WINGS link on the Home page. You can also click on the individual activity title, e.g. "ASEL-Airport Operations (Pvt, Comm'l, ATP)." In this case, individual activity requirements are shown.

There is no minimum time required for each of the activity tasks, or for the activity as a whole. Your CFI will judge when this activity has been completed satisfactorily.

# As a Flight Review Replacement
> [!quote] From [[FAR 61.56 Flight Review]]
> A person who has, within the period specified in [paragraph (c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-61.56#p-61.56(c)) of this section, satisfactorily accomplished one or more phases of an FAA-sponsored pilot proficiency award program need not accomplish the flight review required by this section.

> [!quote] From [[AC 61-91]]
> Airmen who participate in the program and satisfactorily complete a current phase of WINGS will not have to complete the flight review requirements of 14 CFR part 61, § [[FAR 61.56 Flight Review|61.56]]. Section 61.56(e) states that participating airmen do not need to accomplish the flight review requirements of part 61 if, since the beginning of the 24th calendar-month before the month in which that pilot acts as pilot-in-command ([[PIC]]), he or she has satisfactorily accomplished one or more phases of an FAA-sponsored pilot proficiency award program. Each time a pilot earns a new phase of WINGS, it satisfies the flight review requirement regardless of how frequently or closely spaced the phase or award.

From your *My Wings* page, click on the *WINGS Logbook* tab. Select your completed phase, then "Print Certificate for Phase #". This displays your WINGS certificate, customized with your name and completion date. This certificate is proof of completion of a phase of WINGS and can be used in place of your flight review. The 2nd page of the completion certificate also presents a separate wallet-sized certificate with your flight review information.^[Some extra text added to this paragraph by Jack to make finding this certificate more clear]
