# [[WINGS - Pilot Proficiency Program|WINGS]] Phase
> [!caution]
> Note that all WINGS activities, Knowledge and Flight, must be completed within a 12- month period to qualify for completion of a Phase of WINGS.

# Individual Training Activity
## Knowledge Activities
Three knowledge-based activity credits are required for each phase and may consist of courses and/or seminars, either online or in person.

> [!warning]
> You must use the same email address on the external site as you do on FAASafety.gov to get automated WINGS credit!

## Flight Training
Although we recommend you schedule the three Flight Activities over three more-or-less even intervals during a year, you may combine activities in a single day, if you wish.

An activity valued at one (1) credit does not necessarily equal one hour of flight training. Your CFI decides when you have successfully completed this activity and can, in most cases, be shorter than one hour of flight time.
