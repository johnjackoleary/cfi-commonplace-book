### Summary
[[FAR 61.75 PPL Cert from Foreign License|FAR 61.75]] allows individuals with certain foreign pilot licenses to be issued a U.S. private pilot certificate with the appropriate ratings.

This page is meant to capture notes on this process, especially highlighting differences in experience and training requirements that may be good to discuss with a [[CFI]].

### General Process
There is a [great writeup of this process](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/xcp8pr/my_experience_getting_my_faa_ppl_based_on_my/) on Reddit from u/MrTrustor.

Not included in the writeup, but also good to know, [[TSA]]'s [[FTSP]] is not required for this sort of training.

> TSA has clarified that getting a U.S. certificate based on a foreign license ([[FAR 61.75 PPL Cert from Foreign License|reference FAR 61.75]] does not apply to the requirements of the rule.  However, if you choose to apply for a “stand-alone” FAA pilot certificate no longer based on your foreign license, you must comply with this rule. The TSA views this as receiving an initial FAA pilot certificate and qualifies under the TSA definition of flight training.

### Training Differences
There are a few notable differences in expected maneuvers and experience for a [[EASA]] [[PPL]] [[SEP]] compared to an [[FAA]] [[PPL]] [[ASEL]].

#### Night Flight
Although/Since [[EASA]] treats night flying as a separate rating, unless there is an actual restriction on the applicant's license, night flight in the US may be allowed without any additional training required.^[This surprised Jack, but seems to be confirmed by https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/w5d9tn/easa_ppl_to_faa_conversion_without_night_rating/, https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2014/Grossman-Delvag_Luftfahrtversicherungs_2014_Legal_Interpretation.pdf, and https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/practice_areas/regulations/interpretations/Data/interps/2012/Krausz-Beaumont&Son_2012_Legal_Interpretation.pdf]

For this reason, it's a good idea to fly with an instructor before flying alone at night.

#### PIREPs
Taught but not frequently used.

#### Special Use Airspaces
While many airspaces will be familiar, understanding [[MOA]]s, [[TFR]]s, and other special use airspaces will be important.

#### FAA Charts and Chart Supplement
Though similar in content, make sure you can effectively use FAA Charts and Chart Supplements for navigation and information.

> [!info] See [[PPL2.2 Navigation Charts, National Airspace System, and Intro to FARs]] for more info.

#### Radio and Flight Following
Understanding and using services from [[ATC]] is important, especially in locations with busy airspace.
