| [[Filed/Stress Causes Maybe Incorrect Focus.md\|...]]                                   | Stress causes most people to focus narrowly on the thing that they consider most important, and it may be the wrong thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [[Filed/Deep Survival.md\|Deep Survival]] |

| [[Filed/Plato on Reason Versus Emotion.md\|...]]                                        | Plato understood that emotions could trump reason and that to succeed we have to use the reins of [[reason]] on the horse of [[emotion]]. That turns out to be remarkably close to what modern research has begun to show us, and it works both ways: The intellect without the emotions is like the jockey without the horse. | [[Filed/Deep Survival.md\|Deep Survival]] |
